# "Two Lives" book Project


This repository contains the working drafts of the English translation of 
one of the most monumental spirituals books ever written, written in Russian and hence , unfotunately,  not much known to the audience who can'tread Russian.

The book is called "Two Lives". It was written (or it would be more corect to say it was heard and transcribed) by Concordia Antarova in the first half of 20th century.
