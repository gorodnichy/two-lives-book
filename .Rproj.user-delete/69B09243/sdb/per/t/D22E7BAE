She lost her father\nwhen she was eleven years old, so then she was living with her mother. When she was fourteen years old,\nbeing in the sixth grade of a secondary school, she also lost her mother, but she continued her studies and\nfinished the school. Having finished the school, she decided to enter a nunnery. She learned a lot while\nbeing in it, and the church choir helped to develop her inborn musical talent. However, she was always\nfeeling that the life of the cloister was not for her. She met Saint John of Kronstadt, and he told her that she\nwas fated to work and live among other people.\n\nShe decided to go to St. Petersburg where she entered the faculty of history and philology\nand graduated it in 1904. She was offered a job in the department of philology, but her dream was singing\nand theatre. She decided to devote her life to the art. The lessons of singing were expensive, so she had to\nwork hard.\n\nIn 1907 from 160 candidates C. E. Antarova alone was accepted to the Mariinsky theatre\nwhere her career as an artist began. In one year one of the actresses of the Bolshoi theatre of Moscow had\nto move to St. Petesburg. C. E. Antarova was offered her place in Moscow. She moved to Moscow and at\nonce the entire complicated repertoire of contralto was offered to her: “Ruslan and Lyudmila”, “Eugene\nOnegin”, “Sadko”, “Jolanta”, “Werther”, etc. She knew F. I. Chaliapin, S. V. Rachmaninoff and other famous\nRussian intellectuals of that time. She was the student of K. S. Stanislavski in his studio of opera which later\ndeveloped into the Opera theatre of K. Stanislavski. Being fascinated by the personality of K. S. Stanislavski\nand his artistic ideas, she wrote a book about him “Conversations with K. S. Stanislavski”.\n\nC. E. Antarova was performing a lot with symphony orchestras. Her artistic and social\nactivities broke suddenly when she lost her husband in the Stalin’s Gulag.\n\nShe was dismissed from the theatre and in this way she lost all of her future. However, a\nlife’s chance saved her this time, too: Stalin didn’t like the voice of the singer who had replaced her, so C. E.\nAntarova was returned to the Bolshoi theatre...\n\nConcordia Antarova was living two lives of equal value: a creative life of an opera singer and\nan inner spiritual one... Everyone who knew C. E. Antarova-singer knew almost nothing about her spiritual\npath, and on the contrary, those who were naming her as their spiritual leader didn’t pay lots of their\nattention to her theatrical creative activities. Her work “Two Lives” is dedicated namely to those disciples of\nhers who were close to her in spirit. After her death in 1959 her closest disciples were left with four\nhandwritten copies of the novel.\n\nThe novel “Two Lives” first of all is an esoteric novel, revealing the esoteric knowledge which\nis transmitted to the heroes of the novel by the Great Teachers of Mankind. C. E. Antarova herself had her\nown Teacher and a connection to Shambhala.\n\n\n## About “Two Lives”\n\nThis novel will help everyone to reflect on his own place in today’s complicated life and his\nrelations to it. Great examples in this book reveal how people are boiling in their own passions, how they\nare enslaved by them. Later the paths for the reader are revealed along which the Teachers of Life are\nleading people from their passions to liberation, from weakness to fortitude, from fortitude to power, from\npower to beauty...\n\nPopularity of this novel written by C. E. Antarova was fated by the successful synthesis of\nboth Eastern and Western esoteric traditions.\n\nWe can find lots of information about these Teachers in the works by Helena and Nicholas\nRoerich in which their cooperation with the Great Teachers is also reflected. The same Teachers were the\nguardians of Helena Petrovna Blavatsky – the author of “The Secret Doctrine” and founder of the\nTheosophical Society in 19th century.\n\nThe conception of integrity of the Universe, the principals of creative work of cosmic\nevolution, creative work of man’s spirit as the most important factor of development of cosmic evolution\nare revealed in “Two Lives”. The real time disappears in the novel, the historical personalities of various\nepochs meet and cooperate here, because neither time nor space nor physical separation is existing for\nman’s spirit...\n\n\n# TWO LIVES byConcordia Antarova\n\n# Part I\n\n\n# Chapter 1\n\n## At my brother’s\n\nThe events that I now remember are sending me back to the days gone a long time ago, to\nmy faraway youth. Everybody is calling me a little old man for almost a quarter of an age, and only I myself\ndon’t feel to be old; my appearance, which makes the people surrounding me give up their place to me or\npick up a fallen thing, isn’t going so much with my inner cheerfulness that it is simply uncomfortable for me\nto see such a respect to my grey head.\n\nI was twenty years old when I came to stay for a while with my brother, the captain of the\nregiment N, to one big industrial city in the Central Asia. The heat, bright and blue sky, broad streets, not\nseen up to then, with their shady alleys of tall and spread out trees were surprising me with silence. From\ntime to time, a trader would ride by slowly to the market on his donkey, a little crowd of women would go\nby, who cover their faces with black nettings and even wrap themselves up in white and black cloaks, hiding\nall forms of their bodies.\n\nThe street where my brother was living was further from both the centre and the market;\nthere was a nearly absolute silence prevailing in it. My brother was renting a small house with the garden;\nhe was living alone with his messenger and he was using only two of the rooms, so he let me have the\nother three. One of the rooms had all of its windows to the street, while the other one – only two of them.\nSo I chose this room to be my bedroom, although up to now it was loudly called the sitting-room.\n\nMy brother was very educated man. The walls of the rooms were furnished with bookcases\nand book-shelves, loaded with books. This library was completed perfectly, stacked up in order and,\naccording to the catalogue made by my brother himself, it was promising me lots of joy in my future\nunusual life of a recluse.\n\nDuring the first days, my brother was taking me to the city, market and mosques. Sometimes\nI alone would walk about the huge trade galleries with their many-coloured pillars and little Eastern\nrestaurants-kitchens at the crossings. Being in this scurrying, tattling crowd of the locals who used to wear\ntheir bright motley oriental robes, I would feel as being in Baghdad and I would wait that suddenly Aladdin\nwith his magic lamp would come out from somewhere, or not recognized by anybody Harun al-Rashid\nwould march past. And all of these Eastern people with their grand calm, or on the contrary – with their too\ngreat exaltation, seemed to me to be mysterious and attracting.\n\nOnce, when so absent-minded I was lounging about from one shop to another, I suddenly\ngave a start as if with electric current I turned around unwittingly: a very tall middle-aged man with\nabsolutely black eyes and a thick, short, black beard was looking intently at me, while next to him a youth\nof unspeakable beauty was standing, and his dark blue, almost violet eyes were also looking intently at me.\nThe tall brunette and the youth were wearing white turbans and motley oriental robes made of silk. Their\ncarriage and manners were distinctly different from the surroundings, and many of the passers-by were\ncringing to them insinuatingly.\n\nBoth of them had already gone to the exit a long time ago, while I was still standing as\nenchanted, not possessing any power to overcome that impression of their wonderful eyes.\n\nHaving come to myself, I pounced after them, but I left the gallery only when the strangers\nwho had surprised me so much were already sitting in their light carriage and moving away from the\n\n\nmarket. The youth was sitting on my side. Having turned round, he gave me a ghost of a smile and told\nsomething to the older man, but the cloud of the dust lifted by three donkeys covered everything, I wasn’t\nable to see anything anymore and I didn’t have any strength to stand there in the heat of the direct\nsunbeams.\n\n“Who could they be?” I was thinking, coming back to where I had met them. I went past a\nstall several times until I dared to speak to the owner.\n\n```\n“Please tell me who those people are who have just been here with you?”\n```\n“People? Many people are coming to me today,” he answered, smiling cunningly. “But you\nwant to know not about people, but about one tall black man, right?”\n\n“Yes, yes,” I was quick to assent to him. “I saw a tall brunette and a beautiful youth with him\nhere. Who are they?”\n\n```\n“He is our great rich landlord. Vineyards – oh, oh, oh – vineyards! Big trade with England.”\n```\n```\n“But what is his name?” I continued.\n```\n“Oho,” the owner laughed. “You are all burning with impatience to become acquainted with\nthem? He is Mahomet Ali and the young man is Machmed Ali.”\n\n```\n“So they are both Mahomets?”\n```\n```\n“No, no, Mahomet is only uncle, while the young man is Machmed.”\n```\n“Are they living here?” I kept asking him, while examining the silks on the shelves and\nthinking what to buy, so that I could linger more and find out something else about that surprising couple.\n\n“What are you looking for? Do you want an oriental robe?” the owner asked me when he\nnoticed that my look was rummaging through the shelves.\n\n“Yes, yes,” I was glad under the pretext. “Please show me an oriental robe. I want to make a\npresent to my brother.”\n\n```\n“And who is your brother, what is his taste?”\n```\nI had no idea about my brother’s taste for oriental robes, because I had seen him only in his\ntunic or pyjamas.\n\n```\n“My brother is captain T.,” I answered to the owner.\n```\n“Captain T.?” the trader shouted with an Eastern excitement. “I know him well. He already\nhas seven oriental robes. Why does he want more?”\n\n```\nI became worried, but having hidden my excitement, I rattled off boldly.\n```\n```\n“He has donated all of them.”\n```\n“Well, well! He must have sent them to his friend to Petersburg. Buy a good oriental robe!\nLook here, Mahomet Ali told his niece to send it. Oh, oh, it is great!”\n\nThe trader pulled an excellent oriental robe with reddish hues out of his stall. It had mat\ngreyish violet edgings.\n\n```\n“Such one isn’t good for me.”\n```\n\n```\nThe trader laughed merrily.\n```\n```\n“Of course, it isn’t good for you. It is a womanly oriental robe. I will give you this, blue one.”\n```\nWith these words, he unwrapped an excellent violet oriental robe, perhaps a little too\nmotley, but its warm and soft hues should satisfy my brother’s refined taste.\n\n“Don’t be afraid and take it. I know everybody. Your brother is Ali Mahomet’s friend. We\ncannot sell a bad robe to his friend. Your brother is a good man! Ali Mahomet himself respects him.”\n\n```\n“So who is he, that Ali?”\n```\n“I have already told you. Hi is a great famous trader. He is trading with Persia and Russia,”\nthe owner answered.\n\n```\n“He doesn’t look like a trader. He must be a scientist,” I spoke again.\n```\n“Oh, oh, oh, a scientist! He is such a scientist that he knows all your brother’s books. Your\nbrother is also a great scientist.”\n\n```\n“And do you know where Ali is living?”\n```\n“It seems that you haven’t been living here for a long time. Ali’s house is in front of your\nbrother’s house,” the trader tapped on my shoulder unceremoniously.\n\n“There’s a big garden, fenced with a high brick wall, in front of my brother’s house. There’s\nalways a deadly silence there, and even the gates didn’t open at least once.”\n\n“Silence is silence, but today there is no silence. Ali Machmed’s sister is coming. She has\nagreed to marry somebody. If you say that Ali Machmed is a very good-looking man - oh, oh, oh, - then his\nsister is the star from the sky! Her plait reaches the floor, and her eyes – oh!” the trader was throwing up\nhis arms and he even gulped.\n\n“How did you manage to see her? According to your customs, women aren’t allowed to take\ntheir cloaks off, right?”\n\n“They aren’t allowed to do so in the street. We aren’t allowed to do so at our home, too. At\nAli Mahomet’s home all women are walking without any covers. Mullah was talking a lot, but he stopped.\nAli said “Leave”, so Mullah is now silent.”\n\nI said good-bye to the trader, took my oriental robe and went home. I was walking for a long\ntime. I took the wrong direction somewhere, but finally, with much trouble, I was able to find my street. My\nthoughts about the rich trader and his nephew were mixed with my thoughts about the girl of unearthly\nbeauty. I only was unable to decide of what colour her eyes were: black as her uncle’s or violet as her\nbrother’s. I was going with my eyes cast to my feet and suddenly I heard a cry.\n\n```\n“Lovushka, where have you been? I was already about to go looking for you!”\n```\nThe voice of my dear brother, as well as his eyes, were full of humour. He was both my father\nand my mother to me during all my life. His white teeth, beautiful red lips, golden curly hair and his dark\neye-brows were shining in his softly tanned, cleanly shaven face – for the first time I saw what a handsome\nman my brother was. I have been proud of him and I have been admiring him all the time, but now, like a\nsmall child, for no apparent reason, I threw myself on his neck, covered his cheeks with kisses and shoved\nthe oriental robe into his hands.\n\n\n“Your oriental robe and your Ali – that’s the reason why I am so surprised and lost,” I\nsnapped out, laughing.\n\n```\n“What oriental robe? What Ali?” my brother was questioning me, amazed.\n```\n“The oriental robe No. 8 which I bought for you as a present, and Ali No. 1 – who is your\nfriend,” I continued.\n\n“You remind me of the little stubborn Lovushka who loved stunning everybody with his\nriddles. I see that this liking of yours is still hiding in you,” my brother was speaking, smiling with his broad\nsmile that changed his entire face so much. “Well, let’s go home, we won’t be standing here until the night\ncomes, right? Although we don’t see any passers-by, but I cannot guarantee that there isn’t any curtain\nsecretly drawn somewhere, and that no prying eyes are watching us.”\n\n```\nAs soon as we stepped forward, keen brother’s ear heard a horse come rumbling.\n```\n```\n“Wait,” he uttered “they are coming.”\n```\nI didn’t hear anything. My brother took my hand and made me freeze below a big tree,\nexactly in front of the gates of the silent house where, according to the trader’s words, Ali Mahomet was\nliving.\n\n“It could be that now you will see something staggering,” my brother was speaking to me\n“only stand so as nobody could notice us behind the tree, neither from the side of the house nor from the\nside of the street.”\n\nWe were standing behind the trunk of the huge tree where two or three more people could\nfreely hide. Now I also was able to distinguish the running of several horses and the sound of the rattling\nwheels on the unpaved road. In a few minutes, the gates of Ali’s courtyard opened wide. The yard-keeper\nwent on the road, looked round to all sides, waved to someone in the garden and stayed there, waiting for\nthe carriages. There were three of them already.\n\nThe first a simple cart was rolling. Two wrapped up women and three children were sitting in\nit. All of them were buried in packets and boxes. A small chest was tied at the end of the cart. An old man\nwas bringing two elegant suitcases in the old light carriage after them. And finally, in quite a long distance –\napparently, protecting from the dust – one more carriage was driving, which I was unable to make out\nbecause of such a distance. In the meanwhile, the first two carriages had already disappeared in the garden\nbehind the gates.\n\n“Look intently, but keep silent and don’t move, so that we wouldn’t be noticed,” my brother\nwhispered to me.\n\nThe carriage came nearer. It was an elegant calash, harnessed by an excellent black horse.\nTwo women with their faces covered were sitting in it. They had muffled themselves up in mantles. Ali\nMahomet dressed in white came through the gates, and after him was Ali Machmed who was also dressed\nin long white clothes. It seemed to me that the black eyes of the older Ali pierced through the tree behind\nwhich we were hiding. I even had time to see how a ghost of a sneer slipped in his lips. Even the sweat\nstood out on my face. I touched my brother, wanting to tell him that we’ve already been uncovered, but he\nput his finger to his lips and kept watching the approaching calash intently. One more moment and the\nolder Ali went up to the stopped coach. And ... a small, white, wonderful hand of a woman drew the mantle\noff her face.\n\n\nI had seen a lot of women – both on the stage and other recognized beauties, - but only now\nfor the first time I understood what was beauty. Another woman, evidently an old woman, was explaining\nsomething to Ali, squealing at him, while the embarrassed girl was smiling, and she was already prepared to\nlet down the mantle back on her face, but Ali himself carelessly cast it on the girl’s shoulders. Because of\nthis gesture, to the great resentment of the old woman, the disobedient curls of her dark hair came out.\nNot paying any attention to the squealing old woman, Ali lifted the girl who had pressed herself to him. He\nbrought her home like a child. In the meanwhile, the young Ali respectfully landed the old woman on the\nground, who was still grumbling. A silver laughter of the girl came flying through the open gates.\n\nThe young Ali with the old woman had already disappeared, the coach had driven through\nthe gates, the gates had been closed, but we were still standing, having forgotten where we were, how long\nwe were standing there, that we had gotten hungry, that it was hot, that it was indecent.\n\nI turned to my brother, wishing to share my fascinations with him, but I was simply shaken:\nthe face of my always smiling brother was pale, serious and even austere, his blue eyes had gotten darker\nsomehow, and they were sparkling like the eyes of the cat in the night. Even his eye-brows had changed\ntheir usual form, and they were strictly set into a nearly continuous line. In no way, I was able to recollect\nmyself, so I only kelp looking at that strange man whom I didn’t know.\n\n```\n“Well? Did you like my niece Nal?” suddenly I heard a strange metal voice above me.\n```\nI gave a start - because of unexpectedness I hadn’t even understood what I had been asked –\nand I saw the huge figure of the old Ali, standing in front of me; He was stretching his hand to me, smiling. I\ntook that hand automatically and I could feel some sense of relief, even a sigh slipped out of my breast, and\na warm stream of energy flowed down my hand. I kept silent. It seemed to me that I had never held such a\npalm in my hand. Only thanks to my effort, I was able to take my eyes off the burning eyes of Ali Mahomet\nand I looked into his hands: they were white and tender, as if the sun-tan wouldn’t be able to touch them,\ntheir long slender fingers ended in rounded, prominent, reddish finger-nails; his entire hand was narrow,\nsubtle and artistically charming, it was telling about his enormous physical strength, while his iron-will,\nspark-casting eyes fitted to these hands. It was possible to easily imagine that at any moment one could see\na warrior in front of one’s eyes, routing his enemy – it was enough for Ali Mahomet to take off his white\nclothes and take the sword into his hands.\n\nI had forgotten where we were, why we were standing in the middle of the street, I even\ncouldn’t tell for how long Ali was holding my hand - I was as though fallen into a light slumber while I was\nstanding.\n\n“Come, let’s go home, Lovushka. Why don’t you thank Ali Mahomet for the invitation?” I\nheard my brother’s voice.\n\nAgain, I couldn’t understand what invitation my brother was talking about, I only stuttered\nsome obscure word while saying good-bye to tall and slender Ali who was smiling at me. My brother took\nmy hand, and I was going with him, not feeling my feet. Having looked into his face fearfully, I was able to\nsee my dear, close and well-known from my childhood brother Nikolaj again, and not that strange man to\nme, whom I had been watching below the tree and who had affected me so strongly. My childhood habit to\nfind support, help and patronage in my brother, which came even from those days when he was raising me,\nmy habit to address my brother-father with all my complaints, grievances and misunderstandings came out\nnow from the very bottom of my heart, and I uttered with my plaintive voice.\n\n```\n“I want to sleep very much, I am so tired – as if I had walked twenty versts.”\n```\n\n“Very good. Now we will have our dinner, and then you can have a nap for a couple of hours.\nThen we will go on a visit to Ali Mahomet. He is almost the only one here who is living in a European way.\nHis house is furnished in a very good taste, it is really an elegant mix of Asia and Europe. The women in his\nfamily are educated and they are walking without their burqas at home. This is a real revolution in these\nlands. Many times, Mullah and other high-rank religious fanatics were threatening him with all sorts of\nrepressions for such violation of the local customs, but he keeps fighting against the enslavement of\nwomen and the entire nation. His servants are all literate, every day they have their own hours of rest, and\nthat is also a revolution. I heard that a massacre is being organized against him, - and that is a terrible thing\nin these savage lands.”\n\nWe came home talking, then we washed ourselves in the lavatory which was made of mats\nand tarpaulin in the yard and then we sat down to have our dinner. Good, refreshing shower and delicious\ndinner restored my liveliness. My brother was merrily joking, he scolded me a little for my absent-\nmindedness and he was telling me all kinds of comic scenes that would often take place between the\nRussian soldiers and local Muslims. He was delighted with the quickness of wit and ingenuity of the Russian\nsoldiers. The local slyness would rarely overcome the Russian quick-wittedness, and if an Eastern trader\nwould deceive a Russian soldier, he would have to pay dearly for that: in order to punish him, the soldiers\nwould play such tricks on him that any artistic director could envy their fantasies. It must be said that the\nsoldiers wouldn’t do anything vicious, but then the ridiculed, sly trader wouldn’t decide to deceive them for\na long time.\n\nWe finished our dinner imperceptibly. My wish to take a nap had already been gone, and I\nasked my brother to try the oriental robe that I had bought him. Having thrown his tunic off, my brother\nput the oriental robe on. The deep violet hue suited well his blond hair and tanned face. I was admiring him\nunwillingly, and somewhere deep within me a jealous thought flashed that I would never be such\nhandsome man.\n\n“How did you manage to buy this oriental robe?” my brother uttered. “Indeed, I have many\nof them, but I had already tried all of them at least once, and I like this one particularly, I haven’t yet seen\nsuch one. I will certainly put it on tonight when we are paying a visit to our neighbour. Listen, let’s go to my\ndressing-room – and we’ll choose an oriental robe for you.”\n\n```\n“Why?” I gave a shout, amazed. “Are we going there like to a masquerade?”\n```\n“Why like to a masquerade? We will simply dress ourselves like everybody, so that we\nwouldn’t be striking. Today not only Ali’s friends, but also many of his enemies will be visiting him. Let’s not\nirritate them with our European clothes.”\n\nWhen my brother opened the biggest wardrobe in his cloak-room, it seemed to me that\nthere were not eight oriental robes in it, but around twenty different ones, made of all kinds of material. I\neven exclaimed to my astonishment.\n\n“Are you surprised with such amount of oriental robes? But it is usual here to wear seven\noriental robes at once, starting with the cotton one and ending with the silk one. A richer man is wearing\nthree or four silk robes, while a poor man is able to wear only cotton ones, but they are putting them on\none on another, several of them at once without fail.”\n\n“Oh, my god,” I was unable to remain still, “but in such heat you can feel like being in the\ncrater of Vesuvius when you are dressed with several oriental robes at once.”\n\n“It only seems for you to be like this. The fine material is light, and if you put them on one on\nanother, they will stop the direct sunbeams, then the sun won’t be burning your body. Come, try to put\n\n\nthese two oriental robes on and you will see how light and even cooling they are,” my brother gave me two\nwhite oriental robes, made of very fine silk, while he was talking to me. “We won’t try to stick to their\ncustoms fully and very diligently, but we will put four oriental robes on. I beg you, for the time being, put\nthese two white oriental robes on and walk for a while, dressed in them. Get used to them, otherwise\ntonight, with your absent-mindedness you will really look like being in a masquerade and you will disgrace\nboth of us,” my brother continued, smiling and seeing that I was still holding the oriental robes in my hands\nin hesitation.\n\nNot wishing at all to dress myself in Eastern style, but also not wishing to upset my beloved\nbrother, I quickly undressed and started pulling the oriental robes upon myself.\n\n“But they are tight! What kind of oriental robes are they? These are poor gloves!” I was\nscreaming and I started getting irritated.\n\n“You have to button them up; here’s the hook, and here’s the button,” my brother was\nexplaining to me calmly, and with his flexible fingers he quickly buttoned my oriental robes up himself.\n“Now, Lovushka, calm yourself and put this green oriental robe on, too. It is looser and it also needs to be\nbuttoned up. It also has pockets. And on top of them, put this wide and grey one on with red edgings,” and\nagain he helped me very deftly to dress myself.\n\n“Now it’s time to do your feet,” he kept talking. “Usually, so many friends are visiting Ali,\nwho acknowledge half-Asian clothes, so that we could go with our own shoes. We’ll only have to put\nleather galoshes on them, which are usually left at the door. Otherwise, we would have to stay in our bare\nfeet, because one is going neither to a mosque nor home with the same foot-wear that is used on the\nstreet.\n\nI chose the galoshes according to my feet. It turned out that my brother possessed several\npairs of them, too.\n\n```\n“Now we will go to the bedroom, and you will choose a turban.”\n```\n“Why a turban? How will I look like? I’m not radiating too much beauty anyway! Have pity on\nme. Nikolushka, you better go alone,” I was begging my brother.\n\n```\nMy brother was laughing loud and merrily speaking to me.\n```\n“You aren’t going to conquer the heart of the wonderful niece of Ali, are you? And your\nfriends will not see you like this. So why are you worrying that the Eastern clothing won’t give you a lot of\nbeauty? By the way,” he added, after having thought for a while “if you wish, I could make you absolutely\nunrecognizable. I will glue a grey beard for you, and you will look like a famous trader.”\n\n“The further the better!” I gave a shout, laughing. “If so, then I will have to remember that I\nonce was a rather good amateur actor.”\n\n“If today you succeed to play a limping old man, then you will be able to see a lot of\ninteresting and rather unusual things. It is only a pity that I don’t have another white turban.”\n\nAt the same moment, a light knocking on the door was heard. My brother want to the door,\nand I heard his pleasantly surprised voice.\n\n“Oh, that’s you, Machmed! Come in, I was just busy with the clothes of my brother for\ntonight. I want to turn him into an old grey-bearded trader.”\n\n\n“And I brought a white turban and a jewel. My uncle is asking your brother to accept it as the\npresent on the occasion of Nal’s majority,” and he gave me a packet and a case.\n\n“And this is for you from Nal,” and he gave two packets and two cases to my brother. “Don’t\nforget that you must be lame in the left leg and lean strongly with the walking-stick with your right hand.\nAnd if you really want to look like an old trader, then you should stroke your grey beard with your left hand\nas soon as possible. I really happened to know such famous trader who is living in B.,” the young Ali was\nexplaining to me.\n\nHe was smiling, his bright lips uncovered his wonderful teeth, and the couple of his violet\neyes were looking at me seriously, which was not suited for his age. Having bowed his head a little and,\naccording to the Eastern customs, having touched his forehead and heart with his hand, he left us as quietly\nas he had come.\n\nI unwrapped my packet, and a scrap of the finest white material fell out of it. My curiosity\nwas so great that, not even having lifted the silk, fallen on the floor, I opened the case and I unwittingly\ngave a shout out of surprise and fascination. A fastener of excellent work with a prominent, large ruby and\nseveral brilliants, which were wound round by the dark-gold snake decorated with pearls, were so shining\nin the rather dark room that I was unable to take my eyes off it. My brother picked up the fallen silk and,\nexamining the fastener together with me, he explained to me.\n\n“The older Ali in the name of his niece is sending you the white turban as the symbol of\npower and the red ruby as the symbol of love. In this way he shows you that he accepts you to the\ncompany of his friends.”\n\n```\n“And what is he sending to you?” I was interested.\n```\nMy brother unwrapped the bigger packet. There was a very fine white oriental robe. It was\nmade of the material which I had never seen before. It was similar to the white suede and it was finer than\nthe paper of cigarettes. There was a note in Arabic next to the robe, which my brother hid in his pocket\nwithout reading it. There was the same turban as mine in the second packet, only there was an inscription,\nsome kind of a phrase woven in Arabic letters with blue silk on its front end across its entire width – and it\nwas exceptionally wide. I didn’t pay any attention neither to the note nor to the Arabic phrase. I wanted to\nsee as quickly as possible what in my brother’s case was hidden. “If he is sending greetings of love and\npower to me, then what is he sending to Nikolushka?” I thought for a moment. Finally, my brother rolled up\nhis turban with care, hid it in the drawer of his writing-table and opened the bigger case. Large brilliants\nlaid out in a triangle began to glitter in it, and in the middle of them an oval, prominent emerald was\nshining with bluish green light. There was a ring lying in the smaller case, which had the same emerald set\nin the platinum frame.\n\n“Well, this is some Nal’s majority!” I was almost shouting. “If Ali is sending such presents to\nall of his friends on the occasion of this day, then it will probably cost him a half of that vineyard, which the\ntrader was so praising me behind his stall. And why do men need those fasteners at all? They are wonderful\ndecorations for women, but Ali knows that we are single, doesn’t he?”\n\n“We will buckle these fasteners on our turbans above our foreheads. It is the great honour to\nreceive such a present and not at all everybody in the East are granted with it,” my brother answered. “Ali\nhas been living here for ten years. He is descended from somewhere deep in the Himalayas, and at his\nhome, all Eastern customs of hospitality and honour to friendship are respected.”\n\nThe time was passing unnoticed. Twilight was already getting thicker. The night always\ncoming so fast here was already about to flood everything with darkness.\n\n\n```\n“It is time to start making you up, otherwise we may be late and show ourselves impolite.”\n```\nAs soon as my brother said those words to me he pulled out one of the drawers of his\nwriting-table and ... I was taken back once again.\n\n“Wow! Why haven’t you mentioned in any of your letters that you were playing in\namateurish performances?”\n\n```\nThe whole drawer was full with all sorts of make-up, beards, moustaches and even wigs.\n```\n“It is impossible to write about everything, and I could tell you even less during those several\ndays,” my brother gave me a smile, answering.\n\nHe sat me down on the chair and like an experienced make-up man he quickly glued a beard\nand moustache for me, having moistened my entire face with a colourless liquid before doing so, which was\nsmelling pleasantly and refreshed my sunburnt skin. Below my eyes he drew with a brown pencil, gave\nseveral light strokes through my cheeks that were uncovered with the beard, sent some pearl liquid\nthrough my thick black eye-brows, smeared my lips with some cream and told me.\n\n“I will level your curls a little bit more, so that your black hair wouldn’t come out of the\nturban. Change your seat over here,” and he sat me down on the stool.\n\nI have to confess that I was feeling sorry for those curly hair of mine. In my opinion, it was\nthe only thing that I could be proud of, but it is so nice to walk in the heat with short-cut hair that I asked\nmy brother myself to make it short with the clipper. My hair was soon trimmed, and I already wanted to\nstand up off the stool.\n\n“No, no, remain seated, Lovushka. I will wind your head round with the turban in a second\nand I can do it only when you are sitting on the stool.”\n\nI remained seated. My brother uncoiled the turban that seemed to me much longer than I\ncould imagine. He started twirling it into a twist without mercy and quite soon quickly, strongly, but\nwithout the smallest tightening he wound my entire head round.\n\n“It’s all done with your head. We still have to do your feet. Put on these long socks and\nshoes,” he uttered, having taken the white socks and shoes which looked quite bad out of the box.\n\nI put them on, stood up and instantly felt that my left shoe was uncomfortable. Unawares, I\nlimped with my left foot, and my brother obligingly shoved the walking-stick into my right hand.\n\n“Now you are exactly like that deaf-mute, lame old man that you will have to play,” my\nbrother was laughing.\n\nI got angry. It was hot because of the unusual beard. The liquid with which my face was\nsmeared was pleasant in the beginning, but now it was contracting my skin badly. It was inconvenient to\nmy foot, and besides, I was also deaf and mute. With the impatience that was characteristic to me, I\nwanted to yell and declare that I wouldn’t go anywhere and I already was about to tear my beard and\nturban off me, when the doors opened without any sound and the figure of the older Ali emerged in them,\nwhich looked like hollowed out. I was simply paralyzed by his two sparkling eyes. My turban was so pressed\nto my ears that I couldn’t hear anything what he was talking about with my brother. Ali was dressed in\nalmost black oriental robe – so rich was its blue colour. There was another oriental robe under it. It was\nbright crimson and it was tightly pressed to his body. There was the white turban on his head with the\nbrilliant fastener which portrayed the peacock with its stretched out train.\n\n\nSmiling pleasingly and mildly, he want to me with his stretched out hand. When I gave him\nmy hand, he squeezed it, and again the warm current ran across my whole body, only this time I was feeling\njoy, not laziness. Ali took the ring with red jewel off his finger. There was a lion cut in it and some\nhieroglyphs around the lion. Having bowed, he whispered to my ear.\n\n“This ring will open all the doors of my home for you today, wherever you would like to get.\nAt the same time it will help you, if some day in your life you are wounded or if your wound is bleeding.”\n\nAdmiring the ring, I didn’t even noticed how another tall, slender, Eastern figure had shot up\nnext to Ali. I didn’t understand right away that that was my brother, dressed in the oriental robe that I had\ngiven to him today. I only was able to see the slender, dusky, Eastern man with the bright beard and\nmoustache, in whose turban there was the triangle from brilliants and emeralds attached. My brother was\nrather tall, but next to gigantic Ali he seemed to be of the medium height.\n\n“Look into the mirror, Lovushka. I think that you will hardly recognize not only me, but\nyourself, too,” my brother said to me, laughing and clearly seeing my puzzlement.\n\n```\nI turned to the mirror, limping absolutely naturally because of the inconvenient left shoe.\n```\n“You are an excellent artist,” Ali told me, giving a smile, but his entire figure was showing\nsuch an infectious humour that I burst out laughing.\n\nWhile laughing, all of a sudden I saw in the mirror a dark complexion, nearly black, lame old\nman. I looked round and suddenly I heard such a sound laughter that I turned back once again with\nreluctance and I was looking up and down both laughing Ali and my brother with surprise. They started\nlaughing even more, and I cast a glance into the mirror accidentally and again I saw that old dark-skinned\nArab. With difficulty, but finally I grasped that the blackened Arab – that was me. I lifted my hand towards\nmy eyes, made sure that I wasn’t sleeping and asked my brother why I was so black and how it could have\nhappened. To my question he answered like this.\n\n“Lovushka, this is because that liquid did its purpose, but don’t worry. Tomorrow you will be\nwhite-skinned again, even whiter than ever before. Another, the same pleasant liquid will wash away the\nwhole blackness of your face.”\n\n“And now, my friend, don’t forget that during the entire evening you will be lame, deaf and\nmute,” Ali told me, laughing.”\n\nWith these words, he fixed my turban, pulling it on my ears so much that now I really\ncouldn’t hear anything. I only understood that he was offering me to take his hand and to go with him to\nhis house. I looked into my brother – he even had had time to put the room in order, - he gave a nod and\nwe went to the street.\n\n\n# Chapter 2\n\n## The feast at Ali’s\n\nAli was going first in the street, I was in the middle and my brother was after us. Because of\nthe stuffy heat, unusual clothes, the beard which I kept touching and checking out if it was holding well,\nbecause of the inconvenient left shoe and heavy walking-stick, I was feeling myself as if I had gotten into a\nfog. My head was absolutely empty, I didn’t want to talk and I was glad that I would be playing the deaf-\nmute during the whole evening. I don’t understand the language anyway, and now no one will prevent me\nfrom observing this new, unknown life. We crossed the street, but we didn’t enter through the gates which\nas always were firmly closed, but we turned behind the corner, and Ali himself unlocked and locked again\nthe little metal gates of the garden.\n\nI was surprised by abundance of unusually beautiful flowers. The scent of the flowers was\nstrong, but it didn’t make me dizzy. Already walking one next to another along a rather wide avenue, we\nturned into the depth of the garden and went to the lit up house. The windows were wide open. In the big\nlong sitting-room one could see lots of little, low, rounded tables which were moved to the low, wide sofas,\nlaid out along both walls. From the other side of the little tables, there were two low, wide pouffes placed,\nwhich looked like big pillows, put crosswise. If one wanted one could sit down on the pouffes in the Eastern\nstyle, too, by shoving one’s feet under oneself.\n\nThe house was lit up by electricity of which not everybody was aware even in the capitals. Ali\nwas passionately propagating this kind of energy. He had sent home the machines from England and he\nwas trying to connect to this quite powerful network at least the houses of his friends, but even the closest\nof them were not ready for such an innovation. Only my brother and two more doctors were using the\nelectricity.\n\nWhile we were still walking along the avenue, young Ali and Nal joined us. She had put on a\nluxurious reddish oriental robe which I recognized right away. She also had a very splendid burqa which\nwas cast on her shoulders. I had never seen such womanly head cover that was woven with pearls and\njewels; her black plaits twisted round with pearls were almost reaching the floor, and her red lips with a\nsmile were telling something to Ali... I already wanted to lift my turban a little, so I could hear the girl’s\nvoice, but the quick Ali’s glance as though commanded me “You are deaf and mute, stroke your beard.”\n\nI was angry within me, but I was trying not to show my irritation as much as I was able to. I\nwas slowly stroking my beard, feeling happy that at least I wasn’t blind. I looked old visually, so I could\nexamine the beauty and admire her without any interference. The girl wasn’t paying any attention to me,\nbut one didn’t have to be a psychologist in order to understand that her entire attention was focussed on\nmy brother.\n\nNow we were standing in the big terrace that was tangled round with the blooming climbers,\nnot known to me. The chandelier was shining as bright as in the day-time – even the pattern of the carpet\ncould be seen clearly, on which there were lots of feet simply buried.\n\nWhat about the girl? She was of medium height, slender, slim; her miniature, white little\nhands were holding two red roses with their thin long fingers, which she was often smelling, but it seemed\nto me that by doing so she wanted to cover her embarrassment. Her big, almond, green eyes didn’t remind\nme of the eyes of an earthly creature by anything. One could imagine that only angels, geniuses or some\n\n\nkind of higher creatures could have such eyes; but neither these eyes nor their expression didn’t absolutely\ngo with the apprehension of a woman that is usual in our lives.\n\nAli offered me to sit down on the soft sofa, while the girl and young Ali sat down on the\npouffes in front of me. I kept staring at the face of Nal, which was changing like the wave, chased by the\nwind. Not I alone was looking at her like this – the eyes of all three men were glued to her, only their\nexpression was so different!\n\nThe young Ali was sparkling with his dark eyes, and a devotion, simply adoration was shining\nin them. I thought for a while that he is ready to die for her without any hesitation at any moment. Both of\nthem were very similar: the same narrow nose with a hardly noticeable little hump, bright red lips and an\noblong form of the face, but one could feel that Ali was dark brunette with the temperament of the tiger,\nthat his thought could be biting, his word and hand – injuring.\n\nNal’s face was so tender and harmonious, it was smelling of such kindness and purity that it\neven seemed that the prose of this ordinary life with its sadness and suffering were not meant for her, that\nshe wouldn’t be able to utter a bitter word, to cause a pain. She could be only peace, comfort and joy for\neverybody who would be fortunate to meet her.\n\nHer uncle was looking at her with his piercing black eyes so intently and with such kindness\nthat I was unable to imagine it in him in any way. The depth of his eyes seemed to be bottomless, and a\ntender stream was flowing from them to Nal; but it seemed to me that deep inside of him there was a\nhurricane of anxiety, torturing grief and doubts for a successful girl’s fate hiding behind this love flow.\n\nFinally I started examining my brother. He was also looking at Nal intently. His eye-brows – as\nthen, below the tree – again were contracted into a continuous line, and because of the widened pupils, his\neyes seemed to be totally black. He was sitting straight; it seemed that all his feelings and thoughts were\nstretched like a string. He was all covered with his gigantic will, as with an armour, through which no word,\nnor movement could cut their way, and I was almost physically feeling the ring of that iron will.\n\nThe girl was mostly casting looks on my brother. It seemed that in her understanding there\nwasn’t any place for such thoughts that she was a woman, and that there were men sitting around her. She\nwas expressing her feelings straightforward, easily and with joy like a baby. Several times I caught the look\nof passionate love, which she cast on my brother. And again, there was only pure love shining in that look\nwithout the slightest womanly feeling.\n\nAll of a sudden, I was able to understand the big drama of these two hearts, which were\nbeing broken by the national, family and religious superstitions...\n\nThe older Ali looked at me, and now in his so kind eyes I saw a little old man’s wisdom, as if\nhe wanted to tell me “You see, old fellow, how wonderful life is! How easily the people who love each\nother should be living, and how painfully the superstitions are separating them. You see, what the religion\ncould turn into, which as though is leading us to God, but in reality it is overflowing the life of the people\nwho love each other with misfortune, suffering and even death.”\n\nAll of a sudden, an apprehension of man’s freedom and independence opened in my heart. I\ncould feel the whole power of the religious slavery, hanging over the girl, over both Alis and all of their\nadvanced friends, and first of all – over my brother. I was feeling so sorry for my brother and Nal! I saw how\nhopeless their fight for their love was. I estimated my brother’s will which hadn’t let a single more lively\nword slip away, and which was keeping a respectful, chivalrous tone while talking to Nal.\n\n\nThe girl who had been joyful like a child in the beginning became noticeably sad, her\nsurprised and pleading eyes kept glancing at her uncle more and more frequently. The older Ali took her\nhand and asked her something which I was unable to hear. Because of the sudden girl’s movement, when\nshe quickly pulled her hand out of her uncle’s hand and hid her blushed face in the flowers, I understood\nthat they were talking about the flowers. Ali told her something again, and the girl who was blushed like a\nguelder rose touched her lips and heart with the flowers and stretched them out to my brother.\n\n“Take them,” Ali told to my brother so clearly that I was able to hear it, too. “The women of\nour country are presenting the flower to their closest and dearest friend on the day of their majority.”\n\n```\nMy brother took the flowers and squeezed the little hand which gave them to him.\n```\nThe younger Ali jumped on his feet like a tiger. His eyes were simply casting sparks. It\nseemed that he would fall on my brother and strangle him. The older Ali only cast a glance at him and drew\na line in the air with his index finger downwards from top – young Ali fell down to his former place, sighing,\nas though he had absolutely lost his strength.\n\nThe girl turned pale as a ghost. Her eye-brows frowned, and her entire face was reflecting\nher spiritual suffering, almost physical pain. Her eyes were sadly now at uncle now at young Ali. Ali\nMahomet took her hand again, he stroked her head tenderly, took my brother’s hand, joined then and said.\n\n“Today you turn sixteen years old. According to the understanding of the East, you are an old\nwoman already. However, you are still only a child in Europe. From my point of view, you are man already\nand you have to step into life. That cruel conspiracy which you aunt has started so foolishly will not be\ntaking place. You are perfectly educated, so you will be going to Paris and studying there. When you finish\nthe medical department, you will travel to India with me, to my little estate. As the doctor, you will be of\nmore service to mankind over there than marrying the local fanatic, where the rude religious superstitions\nwould trample your heart. Yours and my friend captain T. will not refuse his chivalrous help, and he will\nhelp you to escape from here. Exchange your rings, like the Christians are exchanging their crosses.”\n\nIt was strange to me that not hearing a single girl’s word I could clearly hear what Ali was\nsaying.\n\nMy brother was wearing our mother’s ring on his little finger. I was totally unable to\nremember our mother. That was an excellent, ancient ring made with subtlety from gold and blue enamel\nwith the large diamond. Not even taking thought, my brother pulled his ring off and put it on the fourth\nfinger of Nal’s right hand. In her turn, she untied her ring-snake off her belt. It was hanging on a little chain.\nThe snake had mouthed a large, turbid, colourless jewel up. She put the ring on the fourth finger of my\nbrother’s left hand.\n\nI didn’t have time even to think for a while “What an unlovely stone! As ugly as the snake,\nholding it”, and suddenly I nearly gave a shout out of astonishment. Having been only a piece of glass a\nmoment ago, the jewel began to glitter in all colours of the rainbow. Not the purest, the most faceted\ndiamond had ever shimmered with such long beams. Only the sun light is able to break such beams in the\ncrystal pyramid.\n\nA moan, almost a cry escaped from young Ali. Uncle’s look made him calm down again. He\nhung his head again.\n\n“This is the stone of life,” older Ali said, “and it comes to life again as soon as a man’s energy\ncomes through it. You, my fellow Nikolaj, - you are in full blossom, and your heart is pure, that’s why the\nstone is sparkling so blindingly. While you are growing older, the stone will be going out, too, unless your\n\n\nwisdom and spiritual strength replaces your sinking physical strength. You gave the very dearest that you\npossessed to my niece – love of your mother, which she had given to you with the ring. Nal gave you the\ngift of her great-grandfather who was a man of wisdom. He told her to give the ring to that person whom\nshe will be loving so strongly and faithfully that she would be ready to die for him.”\n\nI cast a glance at young Machmed unwittingly. Not a blooming youth was sitting in front of\nme, but a ghost with the deadly pale face and the eyes which were gone out, not seeing anything. I thought\nfor a while that he was fainted away and that he was sitting only thanks to his balance.\n\n“Today,” Ali Mahomet said, “is the great change in your life, about which I was talking to you\na month ago, my Nal, and for which I have been preparing you for five years. Captain T. and two of your\nloyal servants will lead you to his house. Ali will be going together with you. There you will find European\nclothes, suitable to yourself and your servants. You will put them on and give your oriental robe and cloaks\nto Ali. He will come back here, while all of you with captain T. will be going to the railway station. Rely upon\ncaptain’s honour and love. He will take you to such city and such place where you will be really safe and\nwhere you will be able to wait for me or my messenger. Don’t bother about anything, only value your\nfaithfulness to only law – the law of peace. Be strong and wait for me without any fear and worry. Sooner\nor later I will come. Rely upon captain T. everywhere and don’t be afraid of staying without him. If he leaves\nyou alone somewhere, it means that it needs to be so, but he will leave you with his loyal friends if such\nnecessity arises. And now let’s go to the garden all together.”\n\nWe rose. Young Ali gave me his hand, helping me to go downstairs of the terrace. All of a\nsudden, everything was lost in the darkness – the plugs had burnt out somewhere. Taking advantage of the\ndarkness, my brother, Nal, Ali and two more figures came out of the garden through the little gates silently.\nAt the gates, Ali whispered something else to the ear of his nephew, and he gave a nod. Some people were\nrunning about in the darkness, the servants lit up the candles here and there, and because of it the\ndarkness seemed to be even blacker. In this way, a quarter of an hour passed. It seemed to me that I was\nseeing Nal with her reddish oriental robe again and the cloak put on her face, and as if Ali Mahomet had\nput his arms round her shoulders. However, due to all today’s impressions I was unable to grasp anything\nclearly anymore, so I thought for a while that the beauty was simply appearing to me, whose charm had\nbeen engraved into my consciousness so deeply.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the light became bright again, it blinked about three times again and then\nit kept shining peacefully.\n\n“The get-together begins,” Ali Mahomet uttered clearly, and again I was able to understand\nhis words very well. “Don’t forget: you are lame in your left leg, you are deaf and mute. People will be\nbowing a lot and respectfully to you. Don’t respond to anybody’s bows, only give a little nod to mullah.\nDon’t take anything from the common table, eat only what I will give you directly. When the supper is over,\nthe time will come for Nal to show up. She will be wrapped up in the luxurious cloak. Everyone’s attention\nwill be focussed on Nal’s stealing which has been arranged with the groom beforehand. My friend will\ncome up to you and take you through the garden’s gates. Show my ring to the servant who will be standing\nthere and come back home along the totally different way. At home you will find your brother’s letter.\nChange your clothes and hide everything in such a way as it will be written in the letter. You will have to do\nsome work with the mess left at home, because it is necessary that your brother’s messenger who is\nsleeping now wouldn’t notice anything special in the morning when he is putting the rooms in order,” and\nAli hurried away towards the guests who had just entered through the gates.\n\nThe host was standing head and shoulders above his guests. He would respond respectfully\nto the greetings of some of them with a bow, and they would continue their way into the house, while the\nothers would stop close to him and greet him in European way by squeezing his hand. The guests kept\n\n\ngathering and soon the avenue and veranda were full of many-coloured oriental robes. Talking, laughing,\nstrained waiting of delicious feast, some stories that seemed to be cheerful were creating high spirits.\nHowever, having observed more closely, I noticed that the guests were standing in separate little\ncompanies. Those who were dressed more freely, not according to all rules, were keeping aloof, while the\nrest of them kept turning back to look at mullah like musicians at the conductor. Then I started examining\neverybody even more attentively: perhaps, I will notice another face made up as mine or an artificial beard\nwhich I kept stroking with such dignity.\n\nThe time was passing unnoticed. An Eastern music was heard from somewhere, and several\nservants invited the guests to come inside. In the depth of the sitting-room, next to the door to adjacent\nroom, Ali Mahomet was standing with an unseen man who was very tall and well-built. He was dressed in\nwhite clothes and turban. His beard was blonde with a golden shade, his big and beautiful eyes were dark\ngreen. He was young, about twenty eight thirty years old, and his extraordinary beauty was very striking.\nHe was only a little bit lower in height than Ali, but he had much broader shoulders and was well-\nproportioned – the real medieval knight. My imagination depicted him dressed in the clothes of Lohengrin\nat once.\n\nThe host was greeting the guests coming into the sitting-room with a low bow. All guests sat\ndown on the sofas and pouffes, still keeping the same breaking up into separate groups. Everybody was\nleaving his leather galoshes or shoes at the door, while the servants were placing them on shelves. There\nwasn’t a single woman among the guests. I kept standing, observing how the guests were taking their seats,\nand I was unable to decide where I could find a shelter myself. I already wanted to go back to the garden\nwhen I sensed the look of Ali upon myself. He told something to a boy servant, and he came hurriedly to\nme. Having bowed respectfully, he invited me to follow him and he took me to the table that was close to\nthe host’s one. There were two middle-aged men with motley oriental robes and coloured turbans already\nsitting at the table. They had the foot-wear which seemed to be ordinary to me, and on top of their\nEuropean suits, they had only one silk oriental robe. They bowed to me low and respectfully, but having\nremembered the words of Ali, I sat down on the place shown to me, not giving a nod to them.\n\nWhen all guests were sitting, only then Ali and the tall handsome man sat down. The music\nbegan to play somewhere closer and louder. At the same time the servants started bringing us hot,\nevaporating dishes, placing them at once on all tables. The boys delivered china piyalas and silver spoons\nfor each guest.\n\nOnly not all guests were putting the rich, evaporating pilaf into their piyalas and eating it\nwith their spoons. Majority were thrusting their hands simply into the common bowl and eating from their\ncupped hands. This was inspiring such an aversion to me that I was nearly sickened. I wanted to run away,\nalthough the never soon before mixed crowd was promising an extraordinary and interesting view of\nEastern colours and customs. I didn’t touch the pilaf that was put on our table and I was waiting for the\ndish, promised by Ali. And indeed, the tall blonde handsome man rose from their table and stretched out a\nsilver piyala with a small golden spoon to me.\n\nIt seemed that the honour given to me was very highly estimated according to the Eastern\ncustoms, because suddenly all talking stopped, and the exclamations of astonishment rolled along all tables\nin this silence. According to the guests’ mimics and gestures, they were asking one another who I was.\nSome of them were casting looks on me very seriously. They were telling something to their neighbours,\nwhile they were nodding their heads in agreement. Exactly at this moment, the new dishes were brought\nin, and their scent distracted everyone’s attention off me.\n\nI stood up before the tall handsome man unwittingly, who was stretching out the piyala to\nme. He smiled, put the dish that was brought on the table and bowed in Eastern way. Because of that smile\n\n\nof his, the look of his kind eyes and the purity that was simply blowing from him, I was embraced with such\njoy as if I had seen an old, loyal friend. I bowed low to him, too. The neighbours from my table were asking\nme something which I neither heard nor understood, I only saw their moving lips and questioning eyes. I\nwas saved by the boy who showed them his mouth and ears. They only nodded their heads, looked at me\nsympathetically and started eating the pilaf with relish, thanks God at least not with their hands.\n\nI was surprised when I saw a stewed fruit in my piyala, because I was already quite hungry\nand I would have eaten with pleasure a much more concrete dish. I looked at Ali Mahomet with\ndisappointment. He met my look as if he had been waited for this disappointment. The same piyala was in\nhis hands, he lifted it as though wanting to clink it with me, and he gave me a tender smile. In order not to\nlook like an impolite and ill-mannered guest, I took the spoon and ate several never seen before pieces of\nthe fruit, floating in juice that was similar to red wine. My thoughts about the more concrete dish vanished\nat once: the taste and scent of the fruit were wonderful, similar to pineapple, while juice were giving me\ncheerfulness and cooled me off. I was eating with such pleasure that I even stopped looking round.\n\nIn the meanwhile, there was something to observe. Both of my neighbours took off their\noriental robes and coats. They were left with only fine silk shirt and wide, black woven band, serving as\nwaist-coats for them. I already noticed the impact of the heat at the other tables as well, especially among\nthe European guests. The Muslims, who began to sweat and who were wiping the sweat off their shining\nfaces with their sleeves, kept eating diligently, bespattering their costly oriental robes time and again, but\nthey didn’t undress. Having grown heavy because of the food and heat, they simply became feeble. The\npostures were absolutely free already, the talking was loud, there were arguments starting here and there\nwith such gesticulation and such wild spirits that they were more similar to quarrels.\n\nThe stewed fruit given to me by the handsome man must have had some magic features: I\nwasn’t hot anymore, I didn’t want to tear the turban off my head anymore, I was brisk, and my body wasn’t\nfeeling any tiredness, as though there hadn’t been any of today’s troubles. It seemed to me that I could\neasily cover ten versts on foot. My thoughts were focussed, and I started looking round more attentively.\n\nThe guests seemed to be even ruder, and they reminded me even more of the beasts. I was\nfeeling full of self-control and peace, I was surprised by my self-confidence that showed up and I could\nsense a not yet experienced power of the grown-up man. I remembered my brother, Nal and younger Ali.\nSomehow I wasn’t worried about the first two at all, but I started anxiously looking with my eyes for\nyounger Ali among the guests. In my memory emerged Nal’s figure with her reddish oriental robe next to\nolder Ali in the garden. I was ransacking every table with my eyes, but I couldn’t find Nal’s cousin over\nthere. By chance my look met the host’s eyes, and I as if was reading in them: “Control yourself and\nremember my words – when you have to leave this place and what you have to do at home.”\n\nA wave of anxiety ran through me like a gust that makes the flame of the candle flutter, and\nmy absolute self-control came back again.\n\nDuring that time the dishes on the table were changed many times. The fruit and sweets\nwere already being served. My neighbours were eating relatively little, but they were simply exterminating\nthe melons by pouring some pepper on them. I was afraid of showing my astonishment of such taste more\nclearly, but I saw that almost everybody was eating them with pepper, too.\n\nThe tall, golden-haired handsome man rose from Ali’s table again and gave me the piyala\nwith different kind of fruit now, which seemed to be similar to the rice grain in honey. He shoved a note\ninto my hand imperceptibly together with the piyala, bowed low again and came back to his place. I also\nwanted to respond with a bow to him, but I couldn’t rise from my place, my legs disobeyed me completely.\nIf I hadn’t had my glued beard which was so firmly contracting my cheeks, then because of the\n\n\nlaughableness that was characteristic to me, I would have roared with laughter at the top of my voice. I\nunrolled the note. The following words were written in it in English: “First of all, eat that what I have\nbrought to you now. Don’t try to stand up until you have eaten the whole dish. You are not accustomed to\nour piquant meals, and because of them, as well as because of some wine brands, your legs disobey you.\nHowever, thanks to this dish it will be over after some time. Don’t forget that you have to leave by the end\nof this feast. I myself will bring you to the little gates. As soon as the racket kicks up, stand up and come up\nto the host’s table immediately. I will give you my hand, and we will go into the garden.”\n\nI didn’t want even to consider those hundreds of mysterious, not comprehensible to me\nevents of today, but I wished very much to be able to control my legs again, so I hurried to eat. The meal’s\ntaste was similar to some blobs of the sweat porridge, which were in the sauce made of honey, wine,\nvanilla and some other odorous spices. My neighbours had already stopped paying any attention to me for\na long time. It seemed to me that they were following the always growing racket and excitement of the\nguests with an increasing anxiety. I tried moving my legs, I lifted them up slightly as if fixing my oriental\nrobe – hurrah! – my legs were strong and supple again. The racket in the sitting-room was already like the\nhum in the square of Sunday’s market. Fierce quarrels were boiling here and there behind the tables. The\nguests were swinging their hands widely and, with the expression that is characteristic to the East, their\nsquealing voices were clamouring some incoherent words. I could hear “Nal” and “Allah”. The noise in the\nsitting-room kept growing and it was already turning into the roar of the animals. I didn’t have time to\ngrasp anything when I suddenly remembered that it was time already for me to stand up and go to the\ntable of Ali. I wanted to stand up quickly, but my inconvenient left shoe made me come to myself and\ncontinue playing the limping old man. I could evaluate my brother’s foresight and intellect! If not that shoe,\nheavy turban and the beard that was restricting the movements of my lips, I would have already forgotten\na hundred times that I was mute, deaf and lame.\n\nHaving looked at Ali, I saw that the handsome man had already stood up and he was coming\ntowards me. I crawled out of the table quite quickly, on which I left both piyalas and the spoon. Having\nnoticed my efforts, the golden-haired handsome man came to me in a flash, and the boy ran up to us with\nthe sheet of white, soft paper. He wrapped up both silver piyalas and the spoon in a moment and, having\nstretched them out to me, he bowed low and he was mumbling something. Seeing that I wasn’t taking the\nlittle bundle and that I only was looking at him with surprise, the boy was respectfully poking the dishes\ninto my left hand which was free from the walking-stick.\n\n“Take it,” I heard the voice over me. “Such is the custom. Take it as soon as possible, so that\nno one could notice that you don’t know the local customs. The boy is bowing to you so zealously, because\nhe thinks that you are an important person who isn’t happy with such poor present on the occasion of\nmajority. Let’s go, it’s time,” he finished the English phrase, holding me by my left hand.\n\nI could hardly go. The inconvenient shoe had made my foot so much sore that I was even\nhopping. I was afraid that without help of the handsome giant I wouldn’t have managed to go downstairs to\nthe garden, although the little stairs were low, but they were steep.\n\nAs soon as we walked several steps down the avenue, the lights were out again. A buzz of\njoy, joke or indignation could be heard in the sitting-room. Someone’s shadow slipped close to us and\nthrew a light, thick cover on my attendant, which covered me, too. My guardian took me in his hands like a\nchild and suddenly turned into the very depth of the garden. We came across the watchman by the little\ngates, to whom I showed the ring given to me by Ali Mahomet, and he, not having uttered a single word, let\nus go to the street. My attendant told him several words, the watchman bowed respectfully and locked the\nlittle gates.\n\n\nWe came into the absolutely empty street. Our eyes had already gotten used to the darkness\nwhich kept floating the noise from the garden. The stars were shining in the sky. My guardian put me on\nthe ground, took my inconvenient left shoe off, pulled the turban off my head and, looking attentively into\nmy eyes, told me.\n\n“Don’t waste any time. Life of your brother, Nal and yourself now depends very much on\nyour actions. If you fulfil all indications given to you in the letter that was left in your room on the pillow,\nthen everything will be all right. Now forget that you were mute, dumb and lame, but remember during\nyour entire life how you were playing the old man in the Eastern feast. Good-bye. I will visit you tomorrow\nmorning, but today don’t leave your home, don’t go even into the yard, no matter whatever you may\nhear.”\n\n```\nHaving said it all in English again, he squeezed my hand and disappeared in the darkness.\n```\nWhile I was already unlocking the door of my brother’s house, I saw that the lights in Ali’s\ngarden came on again. “It means that the lights will be on at our house, too,” I thought for a moment and I\nsaw a narrow streak of light from behind the door of my brother’s study. I was taken aback because of the\nmess that I found here when I entered, because I knew my brother’s neatness very well. It seemed that at\nleast several people were changing their clothes here, but I didn’t pay any attention to this external mess.\nAll my thoughts were occupied with my brother’s destiny. Having closed the door firmly, I also locked them\nup, pulled the heavy portiere on them, put in order its fall on the floor, so that the light wouldn’t pass\nthrough the cracks. “First of all,” I thought for a while, “I have to read the letter.” Having made sure that\nthe shutters were closed, the blinds were down and the portiere was firmly drawn, I went into my room. A\nlittle lamp close to the sofa was also on in the room, while the windows were firmly covered, and the\nstrong heat was getting unbearable. I wanted to undress, but the thought about the letter as though\nbewitched me.\n\nI threw off the walking-stick, I took off my top oriental robe and, having come up to the sofa,\nI saw a big blue envelope on the pillow. The following was written with my brother’s hand: “Testament.” I\nsnatched it, opened it carefully and took a note and a couple of letters from it. On one of them there was\nwritten with my brother’s hand: “To Lovushka”, while on another one there was written with unknown,\nrounded, still childish, womanly handwriting: “To comrade L.N.T.”. First of all I opened the note. It was\nshort, and I read it greedily.\n\n“Lovushka,” my brother was writing, “there’s no time. You will know everything from the big\nletter. Now don’t delay. You will find a liquid on your table. Clean the make-up off your face and your hands\nwith it. All clothes scattered in the room, including yours, hide in that wardrobe in the cloak-room, which I\nshowed to you today. Hide the bottle with the liquid for make-up removal in the wardrobe, too. When you\nfirmly close the door of the wardrobe, push an absolutely invisible button on the right, which is located\nupwards on the ninth flower of the wallpaper. A thin wall with the same wallpaper will come down from\nabove and it will hide the wardrobe. Only be sure to inspect everything attentively, so that there wouldn’t\nbe any unhidden items left.”\n\nI remembered in a flash that my attendant had pulled the turban off my head and taken my\nleft shoe off, so I got worried if I hadn’t lost them on my way home, but having looked at the bundle with\npiyalas given to me by the boy, I could also see the turban with that mutilating shoe next to it. My\nattendant must have put all of that into my hands, and I took everything and flung it down on the table as\nsoon as I entered the room, not even thinking about it.\n\nI took some cotton wool. First I moistened my hands, and they turned white instantly. I was\nthinking that I would have to bother with my face and beard for a long time, but similar to milk, smelling\n\n\npleasingly liquid removed the whole blackness at once, my beard came off easily, and I could feel better at\nonce, and it wasn’t so hot anymore. I took another one of the oriental robes off, I took my remaining shoe\nand socks off, I put light slippers on and I started cleaning my brother’s room.\n\nOne could still feel a certain system in this mess. All oriental robes were gathered together\ninto one bundle, the other items were also sorted out and tied up into parcels. I only had to take all of that\ninto the cloak-room. Now a thought about my brother’s messenger struck me, too, but I remembered that\nhe was sleeping as a hero, and my brother used to say that even the thunder of the cannons wouldn’t wake\nhim up. And indeed, having gone out into the corridor, I could hear such snoring that I only smiled and\ncalmed down that my light steps would really not disturb his sleep.\n\nSeveral times I had to come back to my brother’s study for the parcels. Finally I brought all\nshoes, only the turbans were left. I recognized my brother’s turban from the triangle of emeralds. I saw a\ncase on the toilet table and I already wanted to leave the adornment after taking it out, but I decided to\nobey fully my brother’s order, so I took all turbans, cases and put them in the wardrobe. At the same time I\nalso took all my clothes off, I picked the beard, walking-stick, piyalas, the unbearable left shoe and I hid\neverything in the wardrobe. I came back once again and inspected all rooms attentively. I found the case of\nmy brooch, so I brought it to the wardrobe, too.\n\nAgain and again I kept inspecting all corners of my brother’s room and finally I decided to\npress the button that wasn’t so easy to locate in the ninth flower of the wallpaper. There were many ninth\nflowers counting upwards, but finally I succeeded to find something similar to the button in one of them,\nwhich really wasn’t the closest to the wardrobe. I pressed the button, but nothing happened. I had already\nstarted getting irritated, I was calling myself a fool when the light rustle above drew my attention and made\nme lift my eyes up. I almost jumped up from joy: the wall was slowly coming downwards and in a few\nminutes, always accelerating, it touched the floor softly. “True miracles”, I thought for a while, because if I\nhadn’t brought everything to the wardrobe with my own hands, I would have never thought that this room\ncould ever look differently.\n\nHowever, I didn’t have time to reflect on that. Everything that I had seen and experienced\ntoday merged into such chaos that I already was unable to answer myself where the reality ended and\nwhere my fantasy began. I put out the light in the cloak-room, closed the door and came back to my\nbrother’s study. There were several papers and some rests of the letters and newspapers lashing around on\nthe floor. I picked everything up carefully, including the blobs of dirty cotton wool from my room. I cast\neverything into the fireside and set fire.\n\nNow I was able to calm down. I put out the light and came into the sitting-room. I was\nthirsty, but the desire to read my brother’s letter overcame the physical thirst. I read the note once again,\nmade sure that I had done everything precisely and burnt it with the match.\n\nI heard a noise in the street, as though somebody was hollowly firing several times, then\neverything settled down again.\n\nI lay down and started reading my brother’s letter. The further I was reading it the more\nsurprised I became – my brother’s picture emerged before my eyes in an absolutely different way than my\nimagination had gotten used to see him.\n\nMany years passed since that night. Not only I became old during that time, not only my\nbrother and many other participants of Nal’s escape are gone, but the whole life had changed around me;\none, two, three was swept by, thousands of meetings and impressions ran by, but the letter from my\n\n\nbrother Nikolaj is still standing before my eyes the same as I was able to grasp it with my entire\nconsciousness on that faraway, unforgettable night. Here it is, that letter:\n\n```\n“Lovushka,\n```\n_You will be reading this letter when the hour of my great test is striking. But this hour will also\nbe the hour of your destiny; you will have to test and prove with your actions your loyalty and devotion to\nyour brother-father, like you used to call me in exceptional moments of life._\n\n_Now I’m addressing you like my brother-son. Concentrate your whole courage and show your\nentire honour and fearlessness, which I was trying to train in you._\n\n_My life has split in two: I, Christian, officer of Russian army fell in love with a Muslim. I\nunderstand perfectly well that this love isn’t fated to end happily. The net of religious, racial and class\nsuperstitions can build such a wall that the will of the whole regiment, not only the will of one man, may be\ndestroyed after striking against the wall._\n\n_How did I meet the one whom I love? How did I become acquainted with her? You will find\nout everything if the end of the story isn’t sad, to be precise, if the story is created at all and not the deadly\nend. Now I will tell you only the main point, that what you will have to do for me if you want to protect my\nlife and happiness.”_\n\nThere were several missed lines in this place and the follow-up was already written with\nanother, fresher ink and in a more nervous handwriting.\n\n_“You already know Ali Mahomet and younger Ali. You have seen Nal. You will have to play\nthe guest in the feast and... there’s a local custom when the groom has to steal the bride, and at that\nmoment when that happens, you will be suspected of stealing her. If you don’t want to betray me, if you\nperform your role well, which older Ali and his friend will explain to you, then I and Nal might be lucky to\nescape the horror and threats of persecution of the religious fanatics..._\n\n_Pay a visit to colonel N. and tell him that on occasion I left for hunting earlier and that as\nusual I will be waiting for him at our friend forester; if he doesn’t find me there, it means that I left and\nexpect to meet him at trader D. and to bring back a considerable catch with myself; tell him to bring along\none more gun and more bullets. Go to him at eight in the morning, tell him everything as precisely as\npossible and don’t be late._\n\n_Later be sure to rely absolutely in everything upon Ali Mahomet. I’m pressing you to my\nheart. Don’t think about the danger threatening me, but think only if you want to become the protection or\nmaybe the salvation for me and Nal freely, easily and at your own will._\n\n_Good-bye. Either we will meet each other with joy and happiness again or we will not meet\neach other at all. Always be brave, fair and honourable._\n\n```\nYour brother N.”\n```\n\nI looked at the clock. It was almost four in the morning. I heard the noise in the street again,\nas though a flicking of whips, it seemed to me that somebody was knocking on our gates, too, but I\nremembered the instructions of my night attendant on my way home, so I put out the light and I was\nlistening attentively. Several carts drove by in the street at high speed, some voices began to scream,\nseveral shots rang out again, some songs would be sung and then they stopped at once.\n\nIt seemed that some kind of a scandal was taking place in the street. I wanted to cast a\nglance at this at least through the crack, but I didn’t dare to, so that I wouldn’t arouse any suspicion on my\nbrother’s house.\n\nI didn’t want to sleep at all, I also didn’t feel any tiredness. I put on the light again, read my\nbrother’s letter once again, kissed it and took another one.\n\n_“My friend and brother,”_ the letter started with these words, _I’m only a weak woman. You\nhardly know me, and as you can see, there’s a danger breaking into your life because of the unfamiliar\nwoman._\n\n_My brother, my uncle Ali Mahomet who has brought me up is the most wonderful man whom\nlife could ever create. If you want to help me to escape the marriage with a rude, terrible man who is fanatic\nand mullah’s friend, then I’m sure that my uncle will always be thankful to you for doing so, and in his turn,\nhe will be protecting you from all dangers threatening you._\n\n_What can I say to you, my friend and brother? I can only ask you to help me, not being able to\npromise anything in return for doing so. We, Eastern women, we love only once if life gives us a chance to.\nYou are brother, brother-son of that man whom I love. Let my love be love of sister-mother for you. I bow\nyou low and I kiss you. Let the wonderful picture of your brother-father always remain in your heart, and at\nthe same time also loving both you and him_\n\n```\nNal.”\n```\nThere was the noise in the street again. It seemed that several pairs of feet ran close by the\nhouse, the carts were rattling again. I put out the light and I was listening attentively again. This time again,\nas though a little bit further already, the shots rang out, one heavier cart drove by rumbling, and everything\nsettled down again. I struck the match and looked at the clock. It was half past five already, hence it was\nabsolute light outside, but I still didn’t dare to open the windows.\n\nI put on the light in my brother’s room, took the letters and the envelope, I read them once\nagain and, having cast them into the fireside, I set them on fire.\n\nHow peculiarly they were burning! Having blazed up suddenly, then they were almost out.\nMy brother’s letter stood apart and curled up, and I was able to read the following word clearly: “Brother-\nfather.” Then all of them blazed up brightly again, and in Nal’s letter the rounded letters “Nal” were\nrevealed. They were as though on the white spot, surrounded by the fire.\n\nHaving blazed up brightly once again, the letters turned into red things scattered about and\nwere out, so that nobody could see them again in this world with these united signs of love, hope, fear,\ngrief and loyalty.\n\n\nI don’t know if I was sitting in front of the fireside for a long time. I was unable to grasp\neverything that had happened during the day, and this fabulous, fantastic night shook my nerves loose\nonce and for all. I was trying, but I was unable to focus my thoughts in any possible way. Such burden fell\non my heart, which I hadn’t ever experienced in my life. “My brother-father,” – I was repeating in my\nthoughts in hundreds of the softest nuances, and my tears themselves were flowing in streams from my\neyes. It seemed to me that I had buried everything what was the best in this world and, having come back\nfrom the cemetery, I started the life of lonesome, lost and not needed by anyone creature. I didn’t feel any\nfear in my heart for at least a moment, it seemed absolutely natural and simple for me to sacrifice my life\nfor my brother. But how could I protect him? How could I help him by being such unexperienced and\nincapable of anything myself? I was unable to imagine that in any possible way.\n\nThe time was slipping by, while I was still sitting without any thoughts, decisions, only with a\nhuge pain in my heart, and I was unable to stop the streamlet of tears from my eyes in any possible way.\nThe cock had its crowing somewhere near. I gave a start with fright and looked at the clock. It was fifteen\nminutes to seven. I made up my mind: it was time.\n\nI needed exactly that much time in order to dress myself and visit colonel N. with my\nbrother’s assignment. I went to my room, drew the portiere and opened the shutters. It was quiet in the\nstreet.\n\nWhen I was going to the bathroom, I saw the messenger who was already setting the\nsamovar. I told him that he didn’t have to hurry with the tea, because my brother had left for hunting late\nin the evening, and that I was going to report about that to colonel N.\n\nIt seemed that my brother had used to leave for hunting unexpectedly, because the\nmessenger wasn’t even surprised. He volunteered to run to colonel himself, but I answered him that I\nwanted to go for a walk at the same time. Then he explained the nearest way through the gardens to me,\nand in a quarter of an hour I was already dashing out of our garden to the adjacent street. I was hurrying. It\nwas hot. While going through the holiday market, I was working my way through the lively and dense\ncrowd of people, and I was trying not to think about anything, so I could concentrate on the main and most\nimportant moment – the assignment of my brother; even my passion to observe things had fallen into a\ndoze in me.\n\n“Hello!” suddenly I heard a voice behind my back. “Well, are you interested in the market? I\nhave already been running after you for five minutes and I could hardly catch up with you. You must have\npicked something out and wanted to buy it?”\n\n```\nColonel N. was standing in front of me, smiling joyfully.\n```\n“Why, I’m in a hurry to visit you,” I became happy. “My brother asked me to tell you that he\ndidn’t wait till you came and he left for hunting on occasion.”\n\nAnd I named everything what I had been entrusted to in detail – about the meeting, gun and\nbullets.\n\n“Very well!” colonel gave a shout merrily. “My nephew just arrived to see me. He’s a\npassionate hunter, so he’s asking me – simply begging me – to take him with me. If I went with your\nbrother, then there wouldn’t be enough place for him, and now I can take him. However, I’m not leaving\ntoday, but tomorrow at dawn.\n\nWhile talking, we crossed the whole market square. Exactly on this end of the square, next to\nthe ruins of the old mosque, a considerable crowd of locals had gathered. I noticed several Muslim monks\n\n\namong them. They were dressed in yellow oriental robes and had pointed dervish caps with fox brushes on\ntheir heads.\n\n```\n“Well, it seems that these yellow monks got very angry with Ali Mahomet,” colonel told me.\n```\n```\n“Why?” I asked him. “What did Ali Mahomet do to them?”\n```\n“Why, haven’t you heard that they are preparing a massacre for him? And this night, these\nyellow dervishes undoubtedly have played dirty tricks on Ali themselves. Haven’t you heard anything?”\ncolonel kept asking me.\n\n```\nI flinched inside, but I pulled my shoulders calmly and answered him.\n```\n“What I could hear if you are the only person whom I know here and I’m seeing you only\nnow, while my brother left yesterday in the evening.”\n\nColonel gave a nod to this and told me that this night at Ali Mahomet’s place there should\nhave been the stealing of the bride, Ali’s niece, that this was the part of the ceremonies discussed\nbeforehand. Usually the groom accompanied by the company of his friends breaks into the house with\ngunshots, noise and, staging the stealing of the bride in every possible way, he seizes the bride, and\neverybody dashes out with all their might, always firing back in the air, although actually the bride is found\nin the place agreed beforehand, and she is brought there by the old women.\n\nI remembered the gunshots that I was hearing in the night, the noise caused by the carts and\nI didn’t understand whom they had taken away instead of Nal. Seeing that I was silent, colonel decided that\nI wasn’t interested in his story.\n\n“Of course, you, a man from capital, don’t care about our business, but when you are living\nhere, when you see the darkness in which the locals are steeped, clenched in mullah’s fist, then willy-nilly\nyou start feeling for that wonderful, obedient nation and you are accepting to your heart with passion the\nfight against religious fanaticism of such great man like Ali Mahomet. This is an example of man who is\ndevoted to his nation.”\n\nImmediately I made colonel believe that I was very interested in his story and that the cause\nof my absent-mindedness was such colourful, surrounding from all sides Eastern beauty that I hadn’t seen\nup till then.\n\n“Well, so I’m telling you that they,” he gave a nod with his head towards the yellow robes,\n“have played the most horrible story to poor Ali. They stole his niece, hid her somewhere and now they are\naccusing him of organizing her escape with help of some old, limping trader whom nobody knows here. In\nshort, the fact is that this night the groom and his companions stole Nal from the feast, and when they\ncame hurrying home they found only the reddish robe of the bride in the cart, as well as her luxurious\nburqa and a couple of her miniature shoes, while the trail of the bride herself had already been lost. Having\ndrawn down such disgrace upon himself, the groom came running back to Ali’s house. The whole house\nhad already fallen deeply asleep. As soon as they woke Ali up, they sent somebody to the women’s side to\nask the old women to come. When the old women were told that the bride escaped, Nal’s aunt nearly\nscratched the groom’s eyes out. Ali himself had to suppress the old witch. Of course, these fanatics hid the\ngirl in a safe place where no one would find her, so that they could insult Ali and accuse him of Nal’s escape\nand announce the massacre for him. It is very well that your brother left yesterday in the evening. Everyone\nwhose relations with Ali were great may be in danger, because the massacre is the best pretext to kill any\nunwelcome persons and to pay off any personal scores.”\n\n\nI was going close to colonel in silence, immersed in my joyless thoughts about my brother,\nNal, both Alis and the disasters menacing to all of us. Only now I was able to understand how great the\ndanger was. I remembered the deadly pallor of younger Ali several times, as well as his suffering of jealousy\nand seizure of his anger, which he managed to overcome. Which turn the youth will take? Has really no one\nseen where the limping old man disappeared from the feast?\n\nWe came to colonel’s house; he invited me very heartily to drop in, but I refused this,\ncomplaining of a headache, and I hurried back home.\n\n\n# Chapter 3\n\n## Lord Benedict and a journey to Ali’s house in the country\n\nI clearly remembered that the handsome giant had promised to visit me in the day-time.\nHaving come home, first I saw the messenger who was talking to some melon seller by the gates. Now it\nalready seemed everything to be suspicious to me. While passing by, I cast a glance at the melons and the\nseller, then I went to the garden in silence.\n\nI sat down under the tree where I and my brother, we used to drink tea in most cases. The\nmessenger shut the gates down and came running after me with two melons. Having put them down on\nthe table, he brought the samovar, some bread, butter, cheese and then he stopped, waiting patiently. One\ncould see from his entire behaviour that he wanted to tell me something.\n\n```\n“Pour me some tea,” I told him. “It seems that you bought great melons.”\n```\n“Yes, indeed,” he answered to me. “Have you heard that there was a scandal at our\nneighbour? Windows were broken in the night, there were fights and gunshots.”\n\n“How could I hear it? I’m not sleeping as soundly as you are, and still, I didn’t hear anything,”\nI contradicted him.\n\n“Yes, of course. I didn’t hear it myself. The seller just told me about it and he kept asking me\nwhere my master was, whether he spent the night at home. I told him that he had left for hunting\nyesterday. He still kept asking me when he had left and where. So I told him that he had left at five as\nalways, to Ibrahim.”\n\nThere came a rather strong knock at the front door. The messenger hurried to the gates\nclose to the front door. I followed him and thought for a while that I should take the pistol. The gates\nopened, and I recognized my yesterday’s guardian at once.\n\n“Forgive my rather strong knocking and that, apparently, I frightened you, but nobody\nopened the gates after my two bells, so I had to knock,” he was speaking pure Russian, smiling charmingly.\n\nThe guest’s beauty was striking me even more in the bright light of the morning: his regular\nfeatures, irreproachable teeth, small ears and big, almond, emerald green eyes were fascinating me. My\nlook which was full of admiration simply stuck to this so charming, so manly beauty that was youthfully\ntender at the same time. I invited my guest to have breakfast together. He smiled and told me.\n\n“My morning has already passed long time ago. We, Eastern people, are used to get up early.\nI have even forgotten when I had my breakfast, but if you permit, I will sit down at your table and eat a\nlittle piece of the melon with pleasure. The custom of our native land says that one isn’t eating only in the\nhouse of one’s enemy, but I am your loyal friend.”\n\n“Oh!” I gave a shout. “I was always thinking that this was the custom of old Italy, but now I\nwill know that this is also characteristic to the Eastern belief.”\n\n“Well, I am Italian and my homeland is Florence. Don’t think that all Italians are brunettes of\ndark nature. It seemed to the women in Venice that it was even indecent to be dark-haired and they used\nto have their hair dyed in golden colour, although, of course, they used to take not a few pains over it,” he\nwas talking, smiling. “But the colour of my hair is natural, and I don’t have any trouble because of it.”\n\n\n“Yes, it is easy for you when you are so handsome, so proportionally and with such harmony\nbuilt – you can even not care about your large stature which becomes surprising only when a normal\nperson shows up next to you and he turns into a dwarf,” I was talking, while giving him the plate, knife and\nfork for the melon. “Forgive me for being so rude and for not taking my eyes off you. I don’t have enough\nstrength to look into the eyes of Ali Mahomet, because they are piercing me through, and his slender figure\nis stunning because of its height. Although you and Ali are almost of the same height, you aren’t only\noppressing me, but also you are simply attracting me to you like a magnet. Oh, if I could be with you\nforever and work for some goal!” these words slipped out of me in such an exalted and childlike way.\n\n```\nHe laughed merrily and asked me for permission to eat the melon without any knife and fork.\n```\nOnly now I saw, or I grasped to be precise, that my guest was wearing a simple, European,\nsand-coloured suit. The expression of my face must have betrayed my entire astonishment, because he\nblinked at me cheerfully and told me.\n\n“Don’t give yourself away by any chance that you had ever seen me wearing other clothes.\nYou also, having put the turban with the snake on your head, were limping, deaf and mute, right? Couldn’t\nI, just like you, change my clothes only for the feast?”\n\nI burst out laughing. Although one could easily mistake my guest for English, but... having\nseem him once with the turban and oriental robe on, I was unable to refuse my belief that he wasn’t a\nEuropean anymore.\n\n```\nAs though having guessed my thoughts, my guest said.\n```\n“I can assure you that I’m really Florentian, although I have been living in the East for a long\ntime.”\n\nI burst out laughing again. I could clearly see my guest’s wish to make fun of me! This nicely\nlooking man could be twenty six or seven years old at most, and only “over the full measure” like people\nare saying.\n\n“So how old were you when you left Florence, if you’ve been living in the East for so long?” I\nasked my guest. “You are a little older than me, although your appearance, in spite of your youth, wins\none’s respect. You looked much older to me yesterday, but now your European suit and your haircut\nrevealed your age.”\n\n“Yes,” my guest answered to me, looking at me with his eyes full of humour, “your European\nsuit and haircut finally revealed your age, too.”\n\n```\nI was rocking with laughter so much that even my brother’s dog started barking.\n```\nMy guest stopped eating the melon, he washed his hands in the stream of the fountain and,\nstill smiling, he offered me to come inside for a short, intimate conversation. I finished drinking my tea and\ntook my guest to my brother’s room.\n\nHe ran his eyes over all corners quickly and, having pointed his hand to the ashes in the\nfireside, he told me.\n\n“Not good. Why your servant is cleaning so carelessly? There are burnt shreds of the letter\nleft in the fireside.”\n\nI took a newspaper from the table, tucked it under the letter which wasn’t burnt till the end\nand set it on fire diligently.\n\n\n“I see that you did everything very carefully,” he continued, looking round in the room. “By\nthe way, have you taken the decorations out of the turbans?”\n\n“No. It wasn’t mentioned in my brother’s letter. I left them in the turbans and hid them in\nthe wardrobe, to be precise, I buried them, because I won’t be able to lift the wall up,” I smiled to my guest.\n\n```\n“I can help you easily,” he contradicted.\n```\nThe messenger came in and asked for permission to go to the market. I gave him some\nmoney for dinner and told him to buy the most excellent fruit. When he left, I locked the door from the\nyard’s side, I put the key in my pocket, and we turned towards my brother’s cloak-room.\n\n“These doors were left unlocked like this?” my guest reproached me. “And if the messenger\nhad had a look out of curiosity?”\n\n```\nHe nodded his head, and I saw my absent-mindedness again.\n```\nI put on the light; my guest bent down and showed me one more hardly noticeable button in\nthe fourth flower. It was in the same row of the wallpaper where I had found the ninth flower upwards. He\npushed the button, straightened himself and was waiting calmly.\n\nAs it had happened to me when I pushed the button, only after several minutes a light rustle\nwas heard, and a crack showed up between the floor and the wall; the wall kept rising, always accelerating\nand disappeared in the ceiling, as though it had never been here.\n\nI opened the door of the wardrobe and took the turbans out, which were cast on the bottom\nwith disrespect. The guest took both brooches out skilfully, found the cases himself quickly, put the\ndecorations in them and put them into his pocket. Then he found the bottle with the liquid, which I had put\nthere and put it into his pocket, too.\n\n```\n“Haven’t you taken the things out of your brother’s dressing-table?”\n```\n```\n“No,” I answered him, “It wasn’t indicated in the letter, so I didn’t even have a look.”\n```\n“We better take a look if there isn’t left anything valuable that could come in handy to your\nbrother or yourself later on.”\n\nWe came back to my brother’s room, having a chat. The whirls of thoughts were swirling in\nmy head: why do we have to look for the valuable things? Why should something come in handy to us\n“later on”? Isn’t my brother coming back here? All these questions were burning my brains, but I couldn’t\nfind an answer to any of them.\n\nIt was strange that a total stranger was rummaging my brother’s drawers with me, and I\nfirmly believed in his honour and goodwill, not doubting at all that he was doing exactly what was\nnecessary to do at that time.\n\nThe guest took several bottles more out of my brother’s drawers, which we shared in our\npockets. The guest found a plain silver case among different boxes which we didn’t even looked at. There\nwas a peacock engraved on its coloured enamel. The stretched out train of the peacock was decorated with\njewels. This was a jewelry masterpiece. There was a tiny golden key next to the case, which was hanging on\na thin golden chain.\n\n“Being in a hurry, your brother has forgotten this thing which he received as a present and\nwhich he valued very much. Take it, and if life is favourable to all of us, some day you will give it to your\nbrother yourself,” my wonderful guest was talking to me.\n\n\nWhile giving me the case and the key, he touched my hands with both his hands tenderly and\namiably. There was such love shining in his eyes that my irritated imagination and excited heart was\noverflown with peace and belief that everything would end well, that I wasn’t alone, that there was a friend\nwith me.\n\nCould I think back then how much pain I would still have to suffer, how much misfortune\nwould fall on me, what mature and tempered man I would become in three years when finally I would\nmeet my brother, and both of our lives would really be going on well.\n\nHaving taken a good look, I saw that it really wasn’t the case, but a note-book with a lock. I\nhid it in the side pocket of my jacket. We picked out this and that more, what seemed to be important to\nmy guest, we locked the drawers, took everything what we had taken out of them into the wardrobe of the\ncloak-room and closed it firmly; then I pressed the button in the ninth flower again. The wall came down\nquickly, we locked the cloak-room, I put the key in my pocket, and we came back to the garden again.\n\nHere my guest explained to me that I should introduce him to everyone as my friend from\nPetersburg and that I should tell the same to the messenger. Then he handed me Ali’s invitation to come to\nhis country house today where they both, he and his nephew had left early in the morning. The guest didn’t\nmention the night’s events with a single word, and I was feeling shy for some reason and I didn’t make bold\nto interrogate him.\n\nI became so happy that I would still be able to stay with my new friend, so I agreed to come\nto Ali’s at once and willingly. We kept waiting for the messenger in the garden, and my guest’s charm was\nattracting me to him more and more. Grief in my heart and thoughts about my brother were clearing away\nand stayed calm when I was close to him. The messenger came back in an hour and a half. I told him at\nonce that I would be going to the country with my friend from Petersburg. My friend himself also added\nthat we might be not coming back till morning and that he wouldn’t care about us. The messenger gave a\nsmile roguishly and answered as always.\n\n```\n“You can be sure.”\n```\nWe came out to the silent street through the little gates of the garden. The street was buried\nin verdure and dust. Then we turned into a blind alley that leant on a big shady garden. I was following my\nnew friend, and all of a sudden it became strange to me that it was almost twenty-four hours since I knew\nthis man, I experienced so much with him and I didn’t even know his name.\n\n“Listen, friend, you told me to recommend you as a close friend from Petersburg and I don’t\neven know how to introduce you to others or how to call you myself.”\n\nHe smiled, took my arm – I think that it would have been more convenient for him to put his\nhand on my shoulder, so small I was next to him – and told me silently in English.\n\n“It doesn’t mean anything. Your acquaintances will think that I’m really an English lord, but\nsince they haven’t seen a lord in their lives, so it will be very easy for me to play him. By the way, I even\nhave an eye-glass which I can use quite well.”\n\nHe put the eye-glass into his left eye, pressed his lips together somehow comically, separated\nhis short blond beard into two parts, and... I burst out laughing, because he became so puffed-up, haughty,\nand his elegant, intelligent face now seemed inane and stupid.\n\n“You see how funny it is,” he uttered in a wheeze through his teeth, “I can play the puffed-up\nblockhead none the worth than you – the limping old man. Among the strangers I am the lord Benedict, but\nyou can call me Florentian, like everyone is doing.”\n\n\nAs soon as we stepped into the garden we met a couple of my brother’s friends who were\nofficers. It turns out that they were coming to visit us and they became very disappointed when they found\nout that my brother had left for hunting. I introduced them to my friend from Petersburg, the English lord\nBenedict. The lord was examining the poor clumsy officers with pride, from the height of his gigantic\nstature. He was murmuring through his teeth to the questions asked: “I don’t understand”, several times he\ndropped and quickly snatched the eye-glass with his eye-brow. By doing so, he finished the officers\ncompletely off, who had never seen the living lord with the eye-glass and who were staring at him with\ntheir eyes opened wide. Finally, he spoke in a patter that the horses were waiting for us, and that I should\ntell them that I was going to the country to visit his uncle, also an Englishman.\n\nWe said good-bye to each other. I still kept suppressing the laughter that was suffocating me,\nbut when I heard their resentment which they cast after us: “He is an English face!” – I couldn’t bear\nanymore, I was rocking with laughter, and the thunderous, deep voices accompanied me behind our backs.\n\nLord Benedict, like a real Englishman, didn’t even gave a wink, and because of that I wanted\nto laugh even more.\n\nWe crossed the park in silence. There wasn’t a single person, a total silence was reigning\nwhich was being disturbed only by the babble of the fountain and the chirring of the grasshoppers.\n\nA perfect light carriage was waiting for us by the gates of the garden, to which the real\nEnglish horses were harnessed in English style. They were unable to remain still, and the old coachman had\nquite a trouble to hold them. He was wearing a tail-coat, spats and bright brown shoes, he was holding an\nEnglish whip in his hand and he looked exactly as the one whom I had seen in the illustrations of the\nfashionable magazines.\n\nI cast a glance at the lord in astonishment, he elegantly gave a little nod to me and offered\nme to be the first who gets into the carriage. I pulled my shoulders, got into the carriage, he quickly made\nhimself comfortable next to me, he told something to the coachman, which I didn’t understand, and we\ndashed off.\n\nWe left the town quite quickly. I hadn’t seen its environs up to now. The vineyards, gardens\nof fruit-trees, fields of water-melons and melons were extending from both sides of the road. The people of\ndifferent age with turbans kept riding on backs of their donkeys in front of us. Often there were even two\nriders sitting on one donkey. We also used to meet the women who had wound black nettings and cloaks\nround their heads. Sometimes two of them were sitting on one donkey, too.\n\nEverything was buried in dust; the sun was glaring, the heat was burning, and it seemed that\nthere would be no end to this rich and fertile land.\n\nWe were riding about an hour like this. Finally, we turned to the left and after a quarter of an\nhour we got into the steppe.\n\nThe view changed at once, as if we had gotten into a totally different land. The luxuriant,\nfertile verdure was left behind us, and in front of us, the wilderness of the steppe with burnt grass was\nextending as far as our eyes could take it in.\n\nI was lulled by the rhythmical running of the horses, soft rocking of the carriage-springs and\nflickering of the heated air. I didn’t even noticed how I fell into a light slumber.\n\n```\n“We’ll be there soon,” my attendant began to speak in Russian.\n```\n\nI awoke suddenly and... I was stupefied. My night guardian was sitting in front of me, wearing\na white turban and white clothes.\n\n```\n“When did you have time to change your clothes?” I gave a shout, being almost irritated.\n```\nHe laughed merrily, lifted the front seat that was upholstered with velvet, and I saw a box in\nwhich one more oriental robe and a turban already rolled up were lying.\n\n“I changed my clothes as it is required by the Eastern politeness,” – my attendant answered\nme, “because if we arrive dressed in suits, then Ali will have to give to each of us an oriental robe. I think\nthat you aren’t inclined to wait until somebody will give you something, and this is your brother’s oriental\nrobe.”\n\n“Not only I want any Eastern presents, but after the last night’s masquerade and miracles, I\nthink that I lost any wish to dress myself in Eastern style forever,” I snapped out not at all politely and quite\nsharply.”\n\n“Poor boy,” Florentian told me and stroked my shoulder tenderly. “You see, my friend\nLovushka, sometimes man is destined to mature at once; and almost instantly after his youth he must\nbecome a mature man. Be strong! Take a good look at your heart: whose picture is living in it? Be loyal to\nyour brother-father, as he was loyal to you, his brother-son, during his entire life.”\n\nHis words touched my most sensitive wound-attachment and heartache. I could feel the\nnagging sorrow of separation with my brother so strongly again that I was unable to hold back my tears and\nI was simply choking with my grief.\n\n“I made a resolution to help my brother, so why am I thinking only about myself? I must go\ntill the end. I started the masquerade, - so it must go on. My brother himself wanted me to change my\nclothes in Eastern style. So be it!”\n\nHaving swallowed my tears, I took the turban out, put it on my head and then I put the\nmotley oriental robe on my student uniform.\n\nThe house and the garden could already be seen in the distance. The vineyard started in both\nsides of the road, and bunches of grapes in it were already turning yellow and red, ripening in the sun.\n\n“Now your guessing will not be tormenting you for a long time anymore,” – Florentian\nuttered. “Ali will tell and explain you everything, my friend, and you will understand yourself how serious\nand dangerous the situation is.”\n\nI nodded my head in silence. It seemed to me that I already understood that quite enough. I\nwas feeling such heaviness in my heart, as though by leaving the town I had closed an easy and joyful page\nof my life, and a new stage of storm and danger would have waited for me in the future.\n\nWe drove in through the gates and drove up to the house along the long avenue of high\npoplars. As soon as the carriage stopped, and we entered rather spacious hall, Ali Mahomet came hurriedly\nto meet us with his quick and light step. Wearing a white turban and linen clothes which were buttoned up\nunder his neck and which were falling to the ground in wide pleats, he didn’t seemed to be so slender and\nseemed to be much younger to me. His dark face was smiling, while his burning eyes were looking at me\nwith a paternal kindness. He was stretching both of his hands towards me from the distance already.\nHaving surrendered to the first impression, being exhausted with the anxiety which was tormenting me\nduring all that time, I dashed at him, as if I was only ten and not twenty years old.\n\n\nHaving forgotten that one should be strong and hide one’s feelings while being in front of a\nlittle familiar person, I pressed myself to him with a childish confidence. Any formalities were gone, my\nheart was pressed to his heart, and I could feel with all my essence that I was at my friend’s home, that I\nhad one more friend from now on and that I would always be quite at home here.\n\n```\nAli put his arms round me, pressed me to himself and told me amiably.\n```\n“Let my home bring you peace and help. Step into my house not like a guest, but like my son,\nbrother and friend.”\n\nAs soon as he told these words to me, he kissed my forehead, embraced me once again and\nturned me towards young Ali who was standing behind my back.\n\nI remembered this man’s suffering when Nal gave her flowers and ring to my brother. Could I\nexpect something else besides hatred from him when he was so envious of his cousin to the European?\n\nBut young Ali, like his uncle, stretched out both of his hands towards me by greeting me. His\neyes were looking at me boldly and respectfully, and I could see in them nothing else but friendliness.\n\n“Let’s go my brother, I will take you to your room. There’s a shower, clean clothes, so you\ncan change your clothes if you want to. Forgive me, but we don’t have any European clothes here. I\nprepared some light Indian clothes for you. If you want you can stay with your uniform. The servant will\nclean it, while you are taking a bath.”\n\nYoung Ali took me along the whole pretty big house and showed me an excellent room which\nhad windows to the garden and parterre.\n\n“The gong will ring out in twenty minutes, and I will drop in at you. The bathroom and the\nshower are behind this door,” he added.\n\nAs soon as Ali was gone, I threw off my student uniform which I was so proud of with\npleasure, I opened the door of the bathroom and, having noticed that the bath was full of warm water, I\ndashed to splash about with joy. I also wanted to refresh myself with the shower. I didn’t have time yet to\ndry myself well, and the servant was already knocking on the door. He brought me a refreshing drink which\nI drank off and was feeling like a camel in the desert: I didn’t even know I was thirsty until I had the drink.\n\nI was trying to make the servant talk in every language that I knew, but he didn’t understand\nanything, he was only shaking his head in the negative and throwing up his arms sadly. All of a sudden he\nbecame quiet, he started nodding his head while mumbling something, he ran to the wardrobe and\nbrought me the clothes as white as snow – he probably thought that I was asking him exactly about that. I\nwanted to stay with my uniform, but the servant was so glad, he was so happy by having understood what I\nneeded, that I didn’t want to upset him. I laughed joyfully, patted his shoulder and told him.\n\n```\n“Yes, yes, you have guessed it.”\n```\nHe responded to my laugh with even more joyous nodding of his head and repeated as\nthough he wanted to remember it.\n\n```\n“Yes, yes, you have guessed it.”\n```\nHe was uttering the words in such a funny manner that I was shouting with laughter like an\nurchin, and suddenly I heard the gong.\n\n```\n“My God!” I gave a shout, as if the servant was able to understand me. “But I will be late!”\n```\n\nBut he understood my confusion very well. He quickly gave me white silk briefs, long shirt,\nwhite silk robe and another white linen piece of clothing similar to the one that Ali was wearing.\n\n```\nWhen I started putting my clothes on, young Ali knocked on the door. I asked him to come in.\n```\n“Are you ready, my brother?” he asked. “I thought that your short-haired head may be burnt\nby our sun, so I brought you a turban.”\n\n```\n“But I don’t know how to put it on,” I answered him.\n```\n```\n“Just a moment. Only sit down – I will roll the turban up for you.”\n```\nAnd indeed, he wound my head round with the turban faster than my brother did. I was\nfeeling myself easily and comfortably. I put the fabric shoes without heels on my bare feet, and we hurried\nto have our dinner.\n\nWe went out to the garden, and behind the huge horse-chestnut in the shade I saw a\nrounded table. Older Ali and Florentian were already sitting behind the table. I asked them pardon for\nbeing late, but the host asked me to sit down next to him and, having smiled pleasingly, he explained to me\naffectionately.\n\n“When we are living in the country, we aren’t observing etiquette so strictly. If you ever\ndon’t want to, you are allowed not to show up at the table at all. Feel absolutely free and behave yourself\nas plainly, easily and merrily as you can. I will be glad if you stay here for a while. Get some rest and\nconcentrate your forces before your subsequent actions, but if life decides differently, then take all love\nand help from this home and remember me, your eternally loyal friend.”\n\nI thanked him, sat down in the place shown to me and looked at Florentian. He had also\nchanged his clothes and was wearing white Indian garments. Once again I was stunned by his blooming\nbeauty and youth which were not obscured by any little wrinkle of grief or anxiety, and his entire essence\nwas as though spreading happiness to life itself.\n\nHe also looked at me, smiled, suddenly pressed his lips together, gave his left eyebrow and\neyelid a little lift, and I could see the naïve face of lord Benedict again. I burst out laughing like a child, both\nAlis gave a laugh, too.\n\nThe table was laid excellently, but there wasn’t any luxury. The dishes were European, but\nneither meat nor fish nor wine couldn’t be seen. I was hungry and with relish I was eating the soup and the\nvegetables with the most delicious toasts, which were prepared somehow specially. I also didn’t forget the\nmost wonderful fruit. I was so engaged in eating, I was taking such a rest from all my experiences that I\nalmost wasn’t looking at my neighbours of the table.\n\nA refreshing drink was served in pyialas, but it didn’t remind me by anything of that one\nwhich Florentian had brought me during the feast. The dinner passed without any special talking. The older\nmen were consulting about something in a language that was unknown to me, while younger Ali was\nexplaining to me the names of the flowers which were put in the china vase on the table. I hadn’t seen\nmany of them, I had seen some of them in the pictures, but all of them were fascinating me. Ali promised\nme to show his uncle’s greenhouse after dinner, where the most exotic, rarest and special flowers were\ngrowing.\n\nAlthough I wasn’t looking round, I noticed anyway that younger Ali was eating everything bit\nby bit, but little, as though only out of politeness, so that I wouldn’t be distinguished for my appetite,\n\n\nhowever, no matter how many times I was glancing at older Ali, I could see only fruit, honey and something\nsimilar to milk in his hands.\n\nThe dinner was over unnoticed. The change that had happened to young Ali was stunning me\nfrom the beginning, now it was striking me even more. His pure, careless youth was gone. It seemed that\nhe was suffering so deeply that his psyche had jumped into the next level. Unawares, I was comparing our\ndestinies and I thought for a while that I had crossed the threshold of my quiet childhood, too. The door to\nit had closed. Another life started...\n\nSince that moment when Ali Mahomet embraced me, I always wanted to ask him about my\nbrother, but my words were always as if frozen to my tongue and I was unable to utter them in any way.\nNow the sharp pain of yearning pierced my heart again and I looked at the host with a pleading look. Ali\nstood up, as though he had heard my silent question. We followed his example and thanked him for the\ndinner. He squeezed everybody’s hand and, having held mine a little bit longer, told me.\n\n“My friend, would you like to walk to the lake with me? It is not far off, it is by the end of the\npark.”\n\nI became glad that finally I had a chance to have a talk with Ali Mahomet. We moved into the\ndepth of the garden. For a while I could hear the steps of Florentian and younger Ali after us, but then we\nturned into the dense avenue of plane-trees and we were covered with silence that was disturbed only by\nbirds and grasshoppers. I couldn’t see any flowers in this part of the park, the trees here were branchy,\ntheir trunks were of unseen thickness, their leaves and blossom had unusual colours. Two groups of the\ntrees stood up in a special way: black maples and reddish magnolias. Wonderful, big, bright reddish\nblossom was covering the foliage so densely that the trees looked like gigantic reddish eggs. A strong, but\nsoft aroma was spreading from them. I stopped unwittingly, filled up my lungs with odorous air and, having\nforgotten all my terrible thoughts, I gave a shout.\n\n```\n“Oh, what a brilliant, what a wonderful life is!”\n```\n“Yes, my boy,” Ali assented to me in a low voice. “Pay your attention to these two groups of\nthe trees that are growing close one to another. Black maples and reddish magnolias close to them, - and\nalthough being so different, all of them are growing in harmony one close to another, not disturbing the\nharmony of the symphony of the entire universe. Man’s entire life is the chain of black and reddish pearls.\nIt is the real trouble for that person who cannot carry this chain of his life quietly, strongly and faithfully.\nThere are no people whose chain, made of their ordinary, grey days, would have only reddish pearls. Both\ncolours are changing in every chain, and people are stringing them on the string of their spiritual strength\nby carrying everything within themselves. You are not a boy anymore. The time has come for you to open\nyour honour, fortitude and loyalty within yourself.\n\nWe kept walking. We could see the lake already. We turned to the avenue of high cedars\nagain and went to the arbour made of the drooped down branches of the elm. It was shady here, and the\nlake was breathing of cool.\n\nIt seemed that nobody was disturbing the calm of my life, but Ali’s words aroused the storm\nin me. My thoughts were swarming; I was feeling that now I would hear something fatal, but I was unable\nto concentrate myself in any way.\n\n“I saved two lives last night, although it may seem to you that I doomed them to suffering\nand deadly danger. I’ve been dedicating my work to waking up the consciousness of this nation, destroying\nthe horror of fanaticism and making a breach for at least the slightest culture and civilization for a long time\nalready. I have established several schools here – separately for the boys and men, for the girls and women,\n\n\nso they could learn writing in both their own and Russian languages, so that they would receive the most\nelementary knowledge of physics, mathematics and history. All of my endeavours are being met with\nbayonets, not only from the side of mullah, but also from the side of the czar’s government. Both of them\nare calling me a revolutionary, unreliable man. I’m telling you of all of it, so you could clearly see the\nsituation in which you find yourself and you could foresee your further action after evaluating the situation.\nI’m warning you in advance: you don’t have any obligations and you are absolutely free to choose your\npath. Whatever you would hear from me, you will have to decide everything with your own will anyway.\nWhat colour and size of the pearl will be which you will string on the chain of Mother-Life with your own\nhands will depend on your selfless love and work. If you want to withdraw from the fight for your brother\nand Nal, your lord Benedict,” Ali gave a smile, “will take you to Petersburg where no danger will be\nthreatening you. If you remain loyal to your brother – then you will decide yourself what help and role you\nwill take upon yourself in this fight. I was educating Nal myself. We’ve been observing the Eastern way of\nliving only for the sake of appearance, and besides, not so strictly at all. Nal is rather educated, her abilities\nallowed her to acquire the education much higher than that which another person would get in any other\nEuropean university. Five years ago I persuaded your brother to give Nal lessons of mathematics, physics,\nchemistry and foreign languages, because I was unable to teach her regularly myself due to my often trips.\nAll those oriental robes, beards, moustaches which you and Florentian hid in the wardrobe of your brother\ntoday are also related to this. Stupid duenja, Ali Machmed’s mother, whom once I saved from misery and\ndeath, turned out to be ungrateful and vicious. Only by changing all sorts of oriental robes and make-up,\nyour brother was able to get into Nal’s working room as the teacher, while the weak-sighted old woman\nwas certain that she was letting always another teacher in. She used to snore so comically when she was\nguarding Nal during lessons that sometimes the girl would give in and laugh loudly, but the rather deaf\nduenja wouldn’t even wake up.”\n\nTwo great youths showed up in my imagination at once, who were guarded by the half-blind,\nhalf-deaf old woman; for some reason I remembered how I was acting the deaf, limping, dumb person\nmyself and I burst out laughing like an urchin.\n\n```\nAli stroked my shoulder and told me.\n```\n“The time was passing. I understood long time ago what feeling had sprung up between Nal\nand your brother. It was meaningless to appeal to Nikolaj’s honour and wisdom: he had proved that with\nhis behaviour anyway. I wasn’t disturbing their feelings, because I didn’t see any other way out for Nal as\nonly escaping from this pressing fanaticism and I was preparing her for this beforehand. The old fool ruined\nmy entire plan. She started intrigues with the mullah and dervishes behind my back. Finally she agreed to\ngive Nal in marriage to the most furious and wicked religious fanatic of everybody of them whom I knew.\nNow the massacre is being declared against me, because I didn’t agree with the marriage, besides I was a\nguardian to the Christians and revolutionaries. I won’t burden you with the details, you could see yourself\nthat I didn’t succeed in avoiding the marriage. At that time when Florentian took you out of the garden, the\nfeast on the women’s side continued. The women gathered to their side through another entrance and\nover there everything was prepared for the legal stealing of the bride. Ali, my nephew, was acting the role\nof the bride. Having changed into Nal’s clothes, he slipped through to the women’s side in the dark and,\nwhile the confusion with the lighting continued, he was in time for taking the bride’s place. The light on the\nwomen’s side was out for a little bit longer. Everything was happening as needed. The old women took the\nbride to the garden and over there, by passing her from one’s hands to another’s, the groom “stole” her.\nThe stealing was done, as it is accustomed for a famous trader, according to all rules – with the noise,\ngunshots and hubbub. On the way something happened to one of their horses. While the whole band at\nthe head of the groom, armed with the knives, were repairing the harness in the light of the torches, Ali\nthrew his oriental robe and costly cloaks off, left Nal’s shoes which he had taken with himself in the cart,\n\n\njumped out silently – he can do it very well – and vanished in the darkness. Both of us, me and Florentian,\nwe were waiting for him at the little gates and all of us together, we returned to the house which had\nalready become calm and sleeping. Ali suffered a lot. You should have noticed the change that happened to\nhim during one night. He was worshiping his little sister since his childhood. He and Nal, often they also\nused to learn with your brother. Nal – that’s his second “I”, and probably this second “I” is more costly to\nhim than his own life. The storm of jealousy, heavy burden of superstitions, dreams about his happiness\nwith Nal befell on Ali so much that everything had either burn down in him or crush him. He didn’t expect\nthat he wouldn’t become the best Nal’s friend and guardian. He didn’t expect that I would take your\nbrother’s side and give my blessing to this love which Ali was always considering to be pure and chaste. It\nwas unbearable to him to let another man have Nal, and besides that man was the European, as well as\nbecause this time she took the path without him, which was full of danger. So first, all of it finished Ali off.\nOnly his total loyalty to me saved him. In the beginning it was a child’s loyalty and love, later – a youth’s,\nfrom whom I have never had any secrets. His true love to Nal, which has seized him, forced him to forget\nhimself and think only about her. Actually, his love saved not one, but three lives which would have\nstopped because of his hand if his loyalty to me hadn’t overcome everything within him. Tonight, in his free\nwill, he choose his path of life and strung the pearl of renunciation on the string of his chain – the black\npearl like those leaves of the maple, - in order to help the woman live, who looks pretty much like the\nreddish magnolia... I have already mentioned that not today – tomorrow the massacre would be declared\nagainst me. I’d rather not explain to you what it means... When, having driven to the groom’s house,\neverybody noticed that only Nal’s clothes were left in the cart, they reported about it to mullah and\ndervishes at once and, having talked things over with them, they came back to our house. I was surrounded\nby the crowd that was clamouring disgustingly, outraging and threatening. Having taken advantage of one\nmore quiet moment, I commanded my servants to ask the old women to come. They had to take Nal from\nthe house to the garden, to the place that was arranged with the groom. The crowd was waiting. It seemed\nthat everything around was filled with the energy of their anger. The passing minutes of waiting became\nhours. Undoubtedly, the confusion had woken everybody up on the women’s side, too. Soon six old women\nwith Nal’s aunt in front of them were already standing next to me.”\n\n“These people,” I told them, “are accusing you that you didn’t take Nal to the garden, but\nyou gave only her clothes to the groom.”\n\n“An inconceivable howling rose in both groups – among the brutalized men and the women\nwho were shaking with fear and who were angry because of such accusations. Both sides were ready to\ncatch hold one of another. Swinging her arms, mumbling some maledictions, the old aunt was insisting that\nshe herself put Nal’s hand into the hands of the groom. The rest of them were insisting that they saw how\nthe groom took the bride in his hands and he didn’t even noticed that she was too heavy for his weak\nhands. I looked at the groom, he cast down his eyes and was confessing that he hadn’t carried any women\nin his hands up to then and that Nal seemed to him heavier than he imagined. When I asked him if he\nhimself took her in the cart, he showed two of his friends who were tall, strong and he explained that he\nhimself hardly carried Nal to the little gates, and then one of his friends carried her to the cart; both of the\nstrong men were putting her in the cart. I also had to interrogate those men, if there was Nal or only her\nclothes which they put in the cart. Both of them were insisting that nobody else than Nal could be so\nslender and elegant.”\n\n“Where have you taken her to?” I asked them. “The women are stating that they gave her to\nyou, you are stating that you took her from them, in the meanwhile you come to my house to look for that\nwhom you have taken away from it. Well, so where is Nal?”\n\n“Again there were questions asked, they were accusing me and my nephew that we stole\nand hid Nal in my house, that apparently, she ran away at that moment when they stopped because of the\n\n\nharness. They were insisting that Nal was in my harem. There were no limits to the rage of the old women\nand aunt who was absolutely furious already. Finally, the mullah with two dervishes stepped forward and\nasked for permission to inspect the women’s side. The crowd which was attracted by the noise of the night\nand curiosity was terrified by such a decision, but I asked them to fall silent and everybody to remain in\none’s place. I gave permission to the old women, mullah and dervishes to look for her in my entire house,\nwherever they wanted to. The noisy crowd had already raided my entire garden without any permission;\nthe cellar, ice-house, coach house, barn where the machine of electricity was installed received their\nattention, too. It was dawning already. The search continued for a long time. There were even the ones in\nthe crowd were drowsing already, when finally, the mullah and the monks were back. Their sullen faces\nwere telling about the results of the search without any words. Flabby, short groom, irritated by the\nexperience misfortune, was hardly able to drag his legs along already. The mullah understood that it was\nthe best to play a comedy of sympathy to me, so he told a fanciful speech how the old women failed to\nprotect the girl from under uncle’s very nose. The howling could be heard again, and who knows whether\nthe mullah had saved his beard if Ali Machmed and me hadn’t stopped the old women who were totally\nfurious already. The wiser monks were trying to persuade the crowd to break up, so that it wouldn’t draw\nRussian government’s attention to the domestic scandal. I could see a deadly hatred in their eyes and I\ndidn’t have any doubts that they would finish me, Ali and many of my guests and members of the family off\nif there wasn’t light of the morning already and if they didn’t have fear of being responsible before the\nRussian justice. As the locals could see it, the groom made a fool of himself the most. He looked at his\nstrong men angrily, some suspicion flashed in his eyes, all of a sudden he turned his back to them, cursed\nrudely and quickly ran to the little gates. His friends, mullah and the crowd were standing for a while,\nstunned and quiet, then they dashed after the groom, stumbling, knocking one another down or pressing\none another at the narrow gates. The groom kept quarrelling with his friends and mullah behind the fence,\nthen there were cries, several gunshots could be heard once again, the racket of the leaving cart – and then\neverything lapsed into silence. The old women were finished off by shame, and they were really unhappy.\nThey were sincerely making a vow and swearing that Nal and her friends were really sitting at the table\nduring the whole evening, that they had put the black cloak on bride’s expensive mantles, that... I told\neverybody to break up. I told them that I myself would be looking for Nal and that nobody would go in and\nout of the house during the day.\n\nNow I received the message that your brother and Nal are successfully going to Moscow by\nthe fast train, but it doesn’t mean that they are saved. Their lives are in danger until they reach Petersburg\nand get on the ship that is sailing from the Neva port to London.”\n\n“Now let’s proceed to your role,” Ali Mahomet continued after reconsidering something\nbriefly. “You are entangled into this story not because of your free will, but as Nikolaj’s brother, because all\nmy friends, as well as the people who are more or less close to them became enemies to the blind religious\nfanatics. On the other hand, the dervishes have decided that the old limping man who was unknown to\nthem stole Nal. The tracks may lead them to you, and without any doubt, they will lead them to Florentian.\nI am repeating to you: decide everything yourself on your own free will. You can tell me right now if you\ndon’t want to join this entire affair, then you would have to leave to K. immediately,” Ali was referring to a\nlarge commercial city, “with a letter to my friend. You would live there for two or three weeks and then you\nwould come back to Petersburg. If you want to help me to fight for your brother’s life, then make up your\nmind and start acting.”\n\n```\nAli finished the conversation with me in this way.\n```\n\n# Chapter 4\n\n## I become the dervish\n\nMy heart calmed down, everything was very clear to me. I didn’t worry about myself at all,\neven my anxiety for my brother’s destiny had vanished. Ali’s closeness, his power and energy inspired me\nself-confidence and cheerfulness.\n\nThe more I was going deep into the terrible discord of nations with my thoughts, the clearer I\nimagined the darkness of the ignorant, poor and almost always hungry nation – the nation which itself is\nunable to choose even its religion independently, but which slavishly submits to fanatics from its birth, - it\nbecame clearer to me that I couldn’t remain unmoved by the destiny of the people who perhaps were\nstrangers to me, but they had the same blood colour and they were suffering as much as my native Russian\nnation to which my brother had moved me nearer and which was being oppressed by the czar.\n\nAnd the longer I was thinking about the strange coincidence which now had tied me together\nwith the destiny of the strange nation and drawn me into the whirl of superstitions, the clearer I perceived\nthat there were no accidental events, but there was a harmony of the powers prevailing, which is always\nworking naturally and accurately, which is uniting all people – the harmony of the black maples and reddish\nmagnolias.\n\nTaking strength from the bottom of my heart, the tranquillity in me wasn’t only growing\nalready, but it was simply consolidating, it seemed that I had comprehended my heart itself for the first\ntime.\n\n“Don’t think that you have to answer me right away, although of course, we don’t have much\ntime. I think that the events will be developing rather quickly.”\n\n“I can answer you right away,” I told him. “I am so peaceful, my decision is so clear to me\nthat I can remember neither similar and wonderful state nor similar inner peace during my entire life. I\ndon’t have any doubts and I cannot imagine that I could take a different path where I should separate\nmyself from my brother, you, Florentian and all your friends. If my brother was here, then he would unite\nhis life with yours, wouldn’t he? And he would fight for your nation’s liberation together with you, although\nyou are an Indian, and this nation isn’t native for you. I don’t need any reflections in order to take my\ndecision. I am going with you, I am loyal to my brother-father and I am ready to give all my strength for his\nlife and fortune, as well as for the freedom of this nation to which you are serving with such a devotion and\nselflessness.”\n\n“My dear friend, your tranquillity convinces me more that any vows and promises. Let’s go\nback home, there may be some news already.”\n\nWith these words Ali stood up, he embraced me, put his hand on my head and looked into\nthe depth of my eyes with his black and infinite eyes. I was covered with the trembling of some kind of joy, I\nas if lost my consciousness for a while and I came to my senses only in the avenue of cedars, admiring the\nreflection of the sun on the surface of the lake.\n\nThe only attendants of our thoughts on our way home were the chirping of the birds, chirring\nof the grasshoppers and aroma of the trees. I had never felt myself so oddly. It seemed to me that all\nexternal facts had to crush my spirit, but in fact, for the first time in such majestic silence of nature, next to\n\n\nthe man in whom I was feeling an exceptional power and purity, I discovered another, yet unknown life of\nmy heart. I was feeling like a little part of this infinite universe in which I was moving and breathing. It\nseemed to me that any difference between me, the sun, shining water and rustling trees had disappeared,\nthat everybody of us was an individual note of that symphony about which Ali was talking.\n\nAs though I began to understand the meaning of things where all revolutions, the fight of\nindividual men, boiling passions of the entire nations, all wars and horrible elemental forces – everything\nwas prompting the mankind to develop, to strive for equality and brotherhood, harmony and beauty in\ncombined work, where freedom of new life had to make an opportunity for man to give all the best for the\nwelfare of other people and in return to receive what was necessary for his development and individual\nhappiness...\n\nI was immersed in my thoughts. I was filled up with joy and I didn’t even notice how we\nreached the house where younger Ali and Florentian were waiting for us.\n\nHaving exchanged some insignificant phrases about the beauty of the park, we came inside\nand sat down at the table in the open veranda. The table was already set for the tea. The heat abated. The\ntea was served in big tea-pots with beautiful colours and original Chinese pictures. As soon as we finished\none cup of tea each, the servant came in and told several words to the host silently. He asked us pardon\nand left. We kept sitting in silence. We were gone deep into our own thoughts, and none of us was\nrestricted by this silence: everybody was as though concentrated within himself, everybody was getting\nready for the upcoming events in his own way.\n\nIt seemed to me that I hadn’t even been living up to this day, that only today I felt the real\nbond with all people – familiar and unfamiliar to me, distant and close to me, and I evaluated the life newly\nby discussing the question what it meant to be strange, close, who were strangers, who were own people.\n\nDue to this absent-mindedness that was characteristic to my imagination I didn’t even notice\nhow almost an hour was gone.\n\nThe servant came in and said to younger Ali that the host was inviting everybody to come to\nhis study. We stood up, Florentian put his arm on my shoulder, pressed me tenderly to his heart for a while,\nand we went to another side of the house which I hadn’t seen yet.\n\nWe entered a big Eastern room, Ali Mahomet’s study by crossing the hall which I and\nFlorentian already knew. He was sitting at the writing-table, and in front of him, in the deep arm-chair,\nupholstered with carpets, there was a dervish settled. He was wearing a yellow oriental robe and a pointed\ncap, decorated with the brush of the fox.\n\nIt seemed that the surprises of the recent days had affected my nerves so much that I almost\ngave a shout out of unexpectedness. I could expect everything, but to see the dervish, sitting in Ali’s study –\nthat was already beyond my powers. I could feel such irritation that I was ready to attack him.\n\nYoung Ali cast a glance at me and, having understood from my face what was going on inside\nof me, whispered to me.\n\n```\n“Not everybody who is wearing a yellow oriental robe is really a dervish. This is a friend.”\n```\nI was trying to control myself and I started examining the imaginary dervish from head to toe\nintently. And again, I was ashamed of such intemperance of mine and lack of delicacy and attention. If I had\nlooked at the face of this man from the beginning, if I had turned all my attention to him and not to myself,\nthen there wouldn’t have been anything why I could become irritated.\n\n\nThe youth was sitting in front of me. He wasn’t any older than myself or Ali Machmed. His\ndark eyes out of his pulled cap were twinkling softly like the stars, his nose had excellent lines, his face was\noblong, his hands were excellent and their form was refined, although they were sunburnt and numb. His\nfigure was blowing of nobility, even if he was wearing the robe of the beggar. Great wisdom was reflected\nin his face. I wanted to pull that ugly cap off his head so much, so that his forehead would open – it must be\nthe one of the real thinker.\n\nThe dervish was speaking in a language that I didn’t know, and to my shame I wasn’t even\nable to define what kind of language it was. I knew that everything what they were talking about then,\nwould be explained to me, so I was only watching.\n\nFlorentian was sitting with his back turned to the window. He was sitting in front of the\nyoung dervish on whom the direct light was falling down. Although a light curtain of ivory colour was drawn\nacross the window, there was enough light, so I wouldn’t let the slightest movement of the muscles of the\nstranger’s face slip off.\n\nThe truth is, he also was a very good-looking man. He was higher than middle height, broad-\nshouldered and he reminded me my brother of something. Ali Mahomet’s face was so serious that I\nremembered all danger that was threatening my brother at once, and a sharp pain pierced my heart.\n\nThe stranger began to speak again. His original, deep, baritone voice which sounded like a\nmetal would have made many opera singers famous. It seemed that he was proposing something.\nEverybody was silent, as though reconsidering his words, and finally old Ali, having looked at me, told.\n\n“I beg your pardon, my friend. You didn’t understand our language, and I will tell you the\nessence in brief. The mullah and the groom, ostensibly referring to the testimonies of the guests and\nservants, are stating that Nal was stolen by the guest to whom I was passing the dishes during the feast.\nThey are telling that it was a famous old man, limping and grey, who rose from the table exactly at that\nmoment when Nal was stolen. The mullah has declared that there was a witchcraft used and he’s charging\nwith it me and that limping old man whom they are looking for everywhere. They have already started the\nmassacre against me. They levelled to the ground two schools that I had built. Isolation from belief\nthreatens to those women by whom they can find books, and that in these dark, wild lands is more terrible\nthan death. It is rumoured that somebody has seen how the old limping man hid himself in your brother’s\nhouse. It is possible that the wild horde will attack my and your brother’s house, they even might burn\nthem down. I must go to town at once and save the rest of the people from real destruction. You together\nwith Florentian, you have to go to the railway station and try to reach Petersburg, so you could help our\nfugitives over there. I don’t have any doubt that all of us are being spied upon. The czar’s government isn’t\nmeddling into any religious massacre, it doesn’t see or hear anything until it’s convenient for it. If the\nmassacre of my house begins and if anybody finds you or your brother, then you will be dead. Everybody\nknows about our friendship, and if you were caught, then you would be responsible for everybody. This\nfriend is proposing you to change your clothes to dervish’s ones, and Florentian will change his clothes to\nordinary trader’s ones, then you should go to Moscow with the third class train. On your way, you will\ndecide how to save yourselves, while I will be sending you telegrams poste restante to every stop and let\nyou know about the course of events by doing so. Don’t forget that you have to think not about yourself,\nwhile saving yourself imagine that you are only additional two arms and legs, dedicated to save life of your\nfriend, brother-father. Concentrate the entire heroism and fortitude of your heart, so that in the moment\nof danger you wouldn’t give yourself away neither by your absent-minded look nor by any movement. Look\nstraight in the eyes of those who will seem to be suspicious to you. Become a deaf-mute again for a while\nand watch the lips of those who will be talking to you with the attention which is characteristic to the deaf-\nmutes. This will be leading the persecutors away. There isn’t much time. If you want to accept this\n\n\nproposal, Ali and your new friend will help you to change your clothes. In the meanwhile, I will hand\nFlorentian all the things needed for your journey, and we will make arrangements about the telegrams.”\n\nHe rose and left with Florentian. Young Ali and my new friend started dressing me with\ndervish’s clothes, and I agreed with that, unhesitating at all.\n\nAs if all misfortunes weren’t enough for me, they smeared me with that colourless liquid\nagain, and this time they did it to my entire body, while my hands, legs and face were coloured with a\ndouble layer, that’s why they wrinkled and became as though sunburnt. Visually I looked like a forty years\nold man, but this time I didn’t worry about my gone youth and white skin. Talking was not about a\nmasquerade, but about lives of my dear brother and myself. I was trying to remember all those movements\nand manners which my new friend was showing to me and which were characteristic to dervishes.\n\nAs soon as I got dressed, Florentian came in. I couldn’t recognize him: he had a long black\nbeard, bluish grey turban, motley cotton oriental robe which was tied up with a kerchief, and on his legs he\nhad put soft, black high boots. It seemed that a mediocre trader got ready for his goods. His face and\nelegant hands were just as black as mine, while his nails and teeth were terribly dirty.\n\nIf this had happened before, I would have been rocking with laughter, but now I evaluated\nsuch change properly.\n\n“Have you stuck the cap to his head?” Florentian asked. “It is possible that somebody might\ntry to pull it off.”\n\nHe pulled a dark skullcap out of his huge pocket himself and pulled it on my head so firmly\nthat one could pull it off my head only with my skin. He smeared the inner side of the pointed cap with glue\nand pulled it on my miserable head. It was so hot that I could hardly stand on my feet, the cap was too\ntight, and I was feeling bad.\n\nOlder Ali came in and it seemed that he could understand my state. He took a little box from\nthe drawer of his writing-table, opened it and put a white pill into my mouth. He closed the little box and\ngave the rest of them to Florentian.\n\n“The horses will be waiting for you on another side of the lake. You will leave from there,” Ali\nexplained. “There’s hardly enough time to reach the station.”\n\nHaving said good-bye to both Ali and my new friend in a hurry, the two of us, me and\nFlorentian, hurried to the lake along the shortest way. Here we boarded a boat. Florentian paddled to\nanother shore quickly, and in a few minutes we saw an ordinary light carriage that was coming running\ntowards us. Not having said a single word to the coachman, we boarded the carriage and dashed off to the\nstation.\n\nThe station was three versts away from the town, so we drove round it from another side.\nWe found a couple of bundles in the carriage, which were tied up in the cotton shawls, as well as two\nmiserable chests made of wood. Florentian was behaving as though he had never been wearing anything\nbetter than the cotton oriental robe and as though he hadn’t had any understanding about elegant\nsuitcases.\n\nHaving driven to the station, we jumped out of the carriage and got into the noisy, excited\nEastern crowd. Seeing a miserable trader and poor monk, nobody was paying any attention to us.\nEverybody was staring only at richer new-comers.\n\n\nAn old man approached us and volunteered to carry our belongings. Florentian gave him my\nbundle and chest. He thrust his own chest under his arm, took his bundle into his hand as if it was only a\nlittle bag of cotton wool, he told something to the old man, and we went to the station.\n\nAnother old man was waiting for us in the station. He gave two tickets to Florentian. As soon\nas we came to the platform, the train drove up.\n\nWe found our third class carriage and sat down on the dirty bench. Slices of bread, shreds of\npaper, gnawed bits of melons and peels of bananas, oranges and water-melons were rolling round us.\n\nAs soon as we took our places, there was a noise on the platform. All that crowd which we\ncrossed in the station broke into platform, yelling. Having pushed aside the gendarme who was trying to\nhold them, the people were dashing to the first class carriages, swinging their arms. They were also trying\nto get into the international carriage. The crowd swept away the station master, gendarme and the guards\nin a flash. A few people, looking for something, shouting one to another, managed to slip to this carriage\nanyway.\n\nThen not numerous passengers who were frightened and who didn’t understand anything\nstarted shouting, too. The gendarme with the whistle was proclaiming danger, while the group of armed\nsoldiers, carriers and gendarmes were already running to help him. Having had time to raid the\ninternational carriage, the crowd was dashing to the first class, some of them also managed to run to the\nsecond one, but the gendarme caught them here. He drew the soldiers up in a fighting position with his\nsonorous voice, and the whole Eastern crowd scattered to all sides in a flash, not succeeding to force their\nway through to the third class carriages. Everybody was gone as if they hadn’t been here. They were\nscuttling as much as they could, getting through the carriages which were standing on the side-tracks. By\nthe way, perhaps they weren’t interested in the third class carriages at all: looking for Ali himself and his\nfriends, they couldn’t even imagine them to be in these sweepings.\n\nThe train kept standing, although the time for it to leave had already passed long time ago. I\nbroke into a sweat so much that I kept wiping my face with the big motley handkerchief which the dervish\ngave to me. I was using exactly the same movement as I was shown by him. Although I believed firmly that\nit was impossible to recognize us, but I noticed an anxiety that all of a sudden flashed in the eyes of\nFlorentian. Having cast a glance to the platform, I saw that the mullah came up to the old man who was\ncarrying our parcels and who now was staring with his wide-opened mouth in the doorway of the station,\nbut exactly at this moment the station master waved his hand, a deafening third bell was heard, the senior\nconductor gave a whistle, the whistle of the railway engine echoed it, and finally we were off.\n\nWe hadn’t even left the station yet, when a young sarth jumped like a cat into our carriage\nfrom the opposite side of the platform. He was breathing frequently and heavily, apparently because of the\nfast running. Having stepped into the carriage, he didn’t sit down, but simply fell down next to us. I thought\nfor a while that he would faint away in a moment.\n\nFlorentian inspected him, he rocked his head for a while and addressed two old sarths who\nwere sitting in the depth of the carriage. I didn’t understand his language, but one of them stood up and\ngave the panting youth water from the jug made of pumpkin. He quenched his thirst, but was still unable to\ncome to life.\n\nFinally, he calmed down a little and asked Florentian, who was sitting next to me and who\nwas almost covering me with his broad shoulders, if he hadn’t noticed who boarded the train in this station.\n\n“Of course, I noticed. I boarded it myself, my nephew did, and you did,” my friend answered\nhim, laughing and also added “In fact you didn’t board, you jumped in.”\n\n\nSomebody in the carriage gave a laugh, after hearing this. Young sarth had already come to\nhimself.\n\n“Whom are you running from? Perhaps, the czar’s government is persecuting you?”\nFlorentian asked him.\n\n“No,” he answered. “I was chasing for the train, so I could give a very important letter to one\nof our traders. I was told that he was travelling with his nephew namely in this carriage.”\n\nHe stood up, went the whole carriage round, thanked the old man who gave him to drink,\ntalked to him for a while and came back to us again.\n\n“No, there’s neither uncle nor his nephew whom I’m looking for here. And there’s neither\ntheir red-haired friend nor the limping old man in the first class carriage. I will have to jump out at the bend\nand wait for the next train.”\n\nFlorentian was nodding his head with dignity, and by doing so, he was expressing his\ncompassion, because he would have to jump out of the running train.\n\nYoung sarth was explaining to Florentian and the curious persons who had gathered round\nus that he was looking for a trader, his benefactor, and if the people here told him who else boarded this\ntrain, not including me and Florentian, then he and his rich benefactor would repay them for their service.\n\nOne old man let it out that he saw how two women and a youth boarded the last carriage of\nthe train. The face of the sarth brightened up, his eyes flared up, he pushed the travellers who had\nsurrounded us and dashed to the next carriage at breakneck speed.\n\nHe came back to us again in about twenty minutes, and his long physiognomy explained\nwithout any words how it went for him there. Nobody was interested in his coming back. Some of the\ntravellers were already getting ready to get out of the train in the nearest station.\n\nThe sarth sat down next to Florentian again and started whispering something to his ear,\nbeing afraid that I could hear him, but my friend calmed him down, showing to his ears. Anyway, he\nglanced at me a couple of times suspiciously, but having seen that I was attentively watching his mouth, he\nturned away and calmed down. Having thought for a while that there was no use of watching him, I also\ndecided to turn away and look through the window.\n\nThe train was driving fast, it seemed that the engine-driver wanted to win some time. As far\nas my eyes could take it in at a glance, the grey and hungry steppe was stretching everywhere: there was\nneither a tree nor a bush nor a house. I started thinking about the troubles of the locals unwittingly. They\nwere making the richest vineyards, growing wonderful fruit and flowers by irrigating the fields artificially. In\nthe meanwhile the train slowed the speed down considerably. We were driving round a deep ravine. There\nwas a thin stream in its ground. It seemed that the network of artificial irrigation canals started here,\nbecause the whole landscape changed here at once, too. The gardens of kishlaks, big trees of figs, nuts and\nchestnut were looming before my eyes.\n\nWe started driving even slower, and suddenly I saw the sarth jumping out of the train, who\nvanished in the ravine by calculating his jump skilfully.\n\nHe disappeared just in time. As soon as I turned my face to Florentian, two conductors\nshowed up at the door of the carriage, asking to prepare the tickets. Having checked the tickets, the\nconductors went to the next carriage. I was thinking that now I already would find out what the sarth was\n\n\nwhispering to Florentian, but my friend put his finger to his lips imperceptibly and stretched out a little note\nwhich he had clasped in his hand.\n\nThat was the telegram poste restante. It was written in Russian, sent to town S. to trader K.,\nreporting that trader A was alive – and full stop.\n\nI didn’t quite understand how the note got into the hands of my friend, although I thought\nthat sarth left it.\n\nThe train stopped in a quarter of an hour, but nobody boarded our carriage here. Florentian\ntook two books out of his parcel and gave one of them to me. His book was written in Arabian, while mine\nreminded me of a thick and worn out prayer-book. I could understand its cipher as well as that fragment\nfrom the Koran, which my brother was showing to me on the wall of one of the mosques.\n\nHaving estimated the foresight of that person who was preparing our belongings, I gave a\nsmile. What other book could be in the hands of the dervish if not a worn out prayer-book which has seen\neverything in the perpetual journeys of the homeless monk?\n\nOne pious old man brought me a melon and a slice of bread. Another one stretched out two\nlumps of sugar. Once again, in my thoughts I thanked my new friend for the lessons of good manners and\nexpressing gratitude of the monk, especially when he is getting food. Florentian was explaining to\neverybody that I was deaf, but real saint and that my prayers were always reaching God. In the meanwhile\nI, looking down, pressing my hand to my heart, nodded my head several times, not even looking at those\nwho were giving alms to me. Some of them, having heard that I was saint and even loved by God, were\nextending me money, too.\n\nWe were going like this until evening; the night fell suddenly again. Everybody became calm\nin the carriage. Florentian put my soft parcel under my head, told me to go to sleep and sat down by my\nfeet.\n\nI don’t know if I was sleeping for a long time, I only felt that somebody was shaking me\nstrongly. I was unable to wake up in any way, although I comprehended that somebody was waking me up.\nFinally, someone’s strong hands got me on my feet, and I inhaled some ammonia. I sneezed and woke up.\nFlorentian was standing next to me, both of our chests were tied up and put on his shoulder, one of the\nparcels was already sticking out of his arm. He took the parcel on which I was sleeping in his hand, showed\nme the door with his other hand and pushed me a little towards it.\n\nIt was almost dark in the carriage. The candles were already burned down in some of the\nlanterns. There were not many lanterns and they were hanging quite high.\n\nAlthough I could grasp a little because of my sleepiness, but I turned towards the door. I\nimagined that we would jump out of the train like the sarth did. By the way, the train was going at full\nspeed now. I became horror-struck, because my inconvenient clothes of the dervish, which looked like a\nsack, were restricting my movements. A thought flashed without any logical connection that my cap was\nalso glued to my head only because it shouldn’t fall down from such jump.\n\nWe left the carriage in silence, and I had already grasped the grip of the outer door, wishing\nto open it.\n\n```\n“It is still early,” Florentian uttered to my very ear silently.\n```\n“So we are going to jump out of the train that is running at the full speed?” I asked him\nsilently, too.\n\n\n“Jump out of the train? But why should we jump out of it?” he was laughing. “We are coming\nto the big city. We will get out in the station, hire a coach-man for ourselves and go to my friend who is\nliving here. But you still remain the dervish who is indifferent to everything until I tell you to stop, and\nwhoever would address you, keep showing to your ears. The train is already slowing down. You go first and\ngive me your hand. Don’t step back off me for a single second neither in the station nor at the house of my\nfriend. Keep holding like this either by my hand or my belt, as though you were blind and couldn’t move\nwithout my help.”\n\nThe train was coming up to the poorly lit platform. The night was reigning all around, and it\nseemed that there was no living soul, but then we could see the red cap of the station master on duty, the\nhefty figure of the gendarme – and the train stopped.\n\nWe alighted from the train, crossed the empty waiting hall of third class and went to the\nplace of the station. A sarth came up to Florentian and volunteered to take us to the nearest kishlak. Having\nfound out that we needed to get to the city, to a commercial district, the sarth became glad that he was\ngoing the same way and that he would earn good money.\n\nHowever, he was wrong. Florentian like a real Eastern trader was bargaining with him with\nheat. He was sputtering words like peas, rolling his eyes and gesticulating in every possible way. The coach-\nman kept up with him. They were bawling like this for some ten minutes, finally the coach-man gave a deep\nsigh, rolled his eyes up and asked Allah for help. It seemed that Florentian was waiting exactly for this. He\nwas also calling for Allah with his folded hands, pushed me forward, and the coach-man saw the dervish.\nNow he fell silent at once, bowed to me and invited us to his cart. We climbed up and went to the city\nwhich was two versts away.\n\n\n# Chapter 5\n\n## I am playing a servant interpreter\n\nWe were going in silence. The sarth was trying to speak to Florentian, but having heard only\nshort answers uttered in a sleepy voice, he decided that we were tired, so he concentrated his entire\nattention to the horse which was peacefully trotting along the soft road.\n\nThe stars were twinkling above us. After the sound sleep in the carriage, my thoughts were\ndrowsing during all that time, but now they began to move again.\n\nI had never heard the silence of the night in the steppe. As in Ali’s park, I was embraced by\nperception of nature’s majesty again, I was bowing to it. I was looking at the stars scattered in the sky, and\nfor the first time, I could see those constellations which I had seen only in the books until then. These\ncelestial bodies didn’t remind me of the north by anything. They were much bigger and lighter, they were\nshimmering like lamps; now I could understand the poets who were writing about the shimmering light of\nthe stars. And the sky itself, cut by the wide Milky Way, seemed to be lower, it was shining in the contrasts\nof the light and darkness.\n\nIn my thoughts I came back to Ali Mahomet and his affairs. Once again I was pierced with joy\nof meeting him. I was contemplating about harmony and beauty of nature. I was thinking about that power\nof love and happiness that is streaming from nature to man, about that huge grief and the tears with which\nhe himself is filling the world by justifying all his actions in the name of Almighty Creator, and in order to\nprotect Him, he is inviting cruel fanaticism to help, and he persecutes people, not leaving even the right for\nthem to their personal lives.\n\nEven pattering of the hoofs and light shaking of the cart wasn’t lulling me to sleep this time;\nbut suddenly in the silence of the night I was feeling lonely, unhappy and helpless... This weakness\ncontinued only for a moment. I remembered Ali’s words that the time came to show my fortitude and\nloyalty. A wave of cheerfulness and even joy rolled over me. I wanted to fight as soon as possible not only\nfor happiness of my brother and Nal, but for everybody who is suffering from the yoke of fanatics, from\noppression of really mad people who are obsessed with religious superstitions, who consider their belief to\nbe the only truthful and who are destroying everybody who is dying to be free, who is longing for\nknowledge and independent life...\n\nI moved closer to Florentian, I pressed myself to him out of gratitude and I was met with his\npleasant and tender look which as though was saying to me: “There’s no loneliness for those who love\npeople and who want to dedicate all their strengths, fighting for their happiness.”\n\nWe drove into the city already. The entire city, from its outskirts to its centre, was similar to\na continuous garden. The night didn’t seem to be so dark anymore. A mosque and a market-place came to\nlight in the tangle of green streets.\n\nFlorentian told the coach-man to stop, we got out, paid him and moved along that market-\nplace which was guarded by the night watchmen here and there. Several times we turned now to one now\nto another sleeping street and finally we stopped by a little house with the garden. Some time passed after\nFlorentian’s knock, then the little gates opened and a surprised yard-keeper looked us up and down.\nFlorentian asked him in Russian if the master was at home. It turned out that he had come back only about\nan hour ago and that he hadn’t had his supper yet, although he told him that he was very hungry.\n\n\nFlorentian asked him to tell the master that lord Benedict was sending us and that we would\nlike that he would accept us immediately if that was possible. The yard-keeper was delighted with the coin\nthat slipped into his palm imperceptible: having let us come into the garden, he broke into a run to tell his\nmaster about us. We stayed alone. While we were waiting, Florentian carefully thrust his finger under my\nwadded cap and pulled it off quickly; having torn my glued skullcap off quickly, he put the dervish cap back\non my head.\n\nIt was difficult to describe what I was feeling after becoming free of that bandage. I wanted\nto give a shout loudly out of joy, but being afraid of giving myself away, I kept it to myself. I only jumped up\na couple of times.\n\n```\n“What Lordict? You are always mixing everything up!” the words reached us.\n```\n```\n“Remember that you are still deaf until I tell you,” Florentian whispered to me.\n```\nIn the meanwhile I was puzzling over where I could hear that special voice, but I couldn’t\nremember.\n\nThe yard-keeper came back and invited us to enter the veranda. We followed him into the\ndepth of the garden. The verdure with its huge blossom which were like clusters was so dense that we\ncould see the light in the veranda only when we turned to the left.\n\nA servant, still almost a boy, was labouring at the table by laying it in European way. He was\nbringing the dishes which were covered with the plates and fruit which were covered with netting.\n\nFlorentian put our belongings in the corner. We sat down on the little wooden bench next to\nour things. The servant would come in and go out, every time taking a peep at us with disdain and\nunfriendliness. Finally, he told us rather carelessly that the master was waiting for us in his study. Having\nleft our leather galoshes next to our belongings, we came from veranda along the corridor into a big room.\nA grand piano and soft furniture were standing here, but the floor was bare, not like at Ali’s, where the feet\nwere simply buried in carpets.\n\nHaving crossed this room, we got to the closed door, from under which the light was\npenetrating. The servant was going first and he wanted to knock on the door, but Florentian pushed him\naway, he squeezed my hand strongly as though reminding me that I was deaf and knocked on the door\nhimself in his own way.\n\nThe door opened quickly and... it was great that Florentian squeezed my hand strongly,\notherwise I would have given a scream at the top of my voice.\n\nIn front of us was standing the same stranger who gave me the clothes of the dervish in Ali’s\nstudy. Florentian bowed low in front of the master by pulling me down, too. I understood that I had to bow\neven lower until the same hand gave a tug at my shoulders upward.\n\nFlorentian told to the master something loudly, he gave a nod, drew low pouffes close to us\nand commanded something to the servant who had entered with us, only I didn’t understand what he told\nhim. Servant’s physiognomy fell out of amazement, and only the look of the master forced him to bow\ndown respectfully and silently close the door when he left.\n\nNow our friend extended his hand, smiled and his look wasn’t so strict anymore. Tiredness\nand sadness could be seen in his wonderful face.\n\n\n“Haven’t you recognize my voice?” the master said to me, while holding my hand and smiling\ntenderly. “I told several words to the servant in a high tone on purpose, so that you wouldn’t be so\nsurprised later when you hear me. Judging by your forehead and cheek-bones, you are very musical, right?”\n\nI wanted to answer him that I memorized the timbre of his original voice, but in the garden I\ncouldn’t remember whose it was. I started talking, but then I was feeling very tired, and suddenly I was\ndazzled, the floor slipped out of my feet and I dived into the darkness...\n\nI don’t know for how long I was fainted away, but I came to myself because of the pleasant\ncool on my head and something chilling on my heart. Florentian gave me to drink, after several sips he also\nmade me to swallow one of the pills which Ali Mahomet had given to us. I was feeling better pretty soon, I\ncalmed down and I was sitting firmly on the low pouffe. The master was writing a letter. Florentian took the\ncold compress off my head and heart and whispered to me.\n\n```\n“Soon we are going to rest, hold tight.”\n```\nBut now I was ready to keep travelling again, I was feeling so much strength as though I had\njust climbed out of the cool swimming pool.\n\nHaving finished writing his letter, the master called his servant, told him to bring this letter to\nthe addressee immediately and to come back with the response. It seemed that the servant didn’t like the\nplace very much, which he was sent to, and he wanted to contradict already, but having met the attentive\nand strict look of the master, he bowed low and left hurriedly.\n\nWe went to the veranda. We washed our hands in the wash-basin which I hadn’t notice\nbefore. My hands didn’t become any brighter and, having sighed, I thought for a while that I was so tired of\nthe make-up, strange clothes and constant adventures which were becoming like the fairy-tale about one\nthousand and one night.\n\nWe sat down at the table. Fruit, vegetables, refreshing juice drinks and the bread of several\nkinds were waiting for us here. Everything was very delicious, but I hardly wanted to eat. Both of my older\nfriends weren’t eating much, too.\n\n“I have written the letter in my servant’s language, because I’m sure that he not only will\nread it himself, but he also will take it to mullah. The news about the massacre against Ali has reached us\nhere, too. In that letter I’m writing to my familiar donkey trader that tomorrow evening my friend who is\nalso a trader will visit him to buy up donkeys. I’m asking him to take care of as big herd as possible, because\nmy friend might buy it all. Our local mullah who is using this trader’s name as a cover is carrying out a large-\nscale trade of donkeys and cattle. Now he undoubtedly will be occupied the whole day, he will be giving\ninstructions what to drive from where and what price to ask. He will finally find some time for his feat\nagainst Ali only in the evening. That familiar trader of mine is living rather far from here, and we have about\nthree hours. During that time both of you need to take a bath, change your clothes, become Europeans\nagain and come back to K. There’s a railway intersection there. You will take an international train travelling\nin the opposite direction, and I think that you will come to Moscow successfully. This time you will not\navoid an unusual suit, too,” he addressed me. “You will be the servant-guide of the lord Benedict who\ndoesn’t know a single Russian word. You have to come back to K., because there’s a fair taking place over\nthere, and the train is swarmed with the foreigners who are coming there to buy astrakhan, carpets and\nstill not harvested cotton. Lord Benedict will interblend among them easily. By the way, they are already\npursuing you. Somebody betrayed that you were dressed like a dervish. I believe that there was no fear in\nyour heart and that there is no fear in your heart now, but you have to act not only bravely, but also\n\n\naccurately. Let’s go to my bedroom. I will try to help you to wash yourselves and to change your clothes for\nthe new roles.”\n\nIt was dawning already. We rose from the table and followed the master into his bedroom. It\nwas a wonderful, white room. There was a very simple furniture, upholstered with light grey silk, but it had\nan elegant form, there was a soft, light carpet there... but there was no time to look over the room.\n\nHaving drawn the folding door aside, the master took me to the bath. He poured some liquid\ninto the bath, and because of the liquid the water simply boiled up. When the surface of the water settled\ndown, he explained to me.\n\n“Now the whole make-up will come off your body. You will get off the water like a white-\nskinned youth again. Here’s the soap, brushes and everything what you may need,” he showed them to me\nand left me alone.\n\nI took off my clothes quickly and dived into the water. It was very pleasing to feel how the\nwhole blackness and the dust of the travel were coming off me like a skin. I could hear the murmuring\nwater somewhere close to me, it must have been Florentian taking the shower.\n\nI didn’t linger in the bath, I muffled myself up in the bathing sheet and started thinking what I\nshould put on. There was a light knock on the door, Florentian came in. He also had wrapped himself up in\nthe sheet, he was smiling merrily, and again I yielded to the charm of this wonderful beauty – to the charm\nof the great and loving man. I understood that I was attaching myself more and more to my wonderful\nfriend.\n\n```\n“Let’s go to pick up some clothes,” he invited me merrily to the bedroom of the master.\n```\nI still didn’t tell you how the imaginary dervish looked like this time. He was wearing a light,\ngrey suit which fitted him perfectly, a white silk shirt with an open wide collar, he had white fabric shoes\non. I couldn’t recognize him: his eyes-stars had a certain original expression of wisdom, they were shining\nwith fire, and that metal timbre of his voice was characteristic only to him. His upper lip which was as\nthough hewed by the sculptor’s chisel was telling about his huge temperament, and his forehead – high and\nnoble forehead of a wise man – had such elevations above his eye-brows that it seemed that the entire\npower of his thought was concentrated exactly here, like it is characteristic to the famous composers.\n\nI couldn’t help but recognize him, but not his European appearance was surprising me, I\ndidn’t understand how he managed to come home almost at the same time as we got here. This showing\nup of his seemed to be unreal in the mess of my thoughts, but in fact he was travelling in a much simpler\nway than we were. There was less than half an hour way from Ali’s estate to a little station before K. Having\nchanged his clothes as a simple man, he got into our train, but he didn’t show himself to us. He reached his\nhome earlier, because Florentian, as it is accustomed for the petty traders, was bargaining himself hoarse,\nand that comedy took lots of our time, in addition our horse looked more like a donkey.\n\nWhile we were dressing ourselves, the master told us about his journey and about Ali’s\naffairs. Ali left to town, so he could protect and save his family, but what his subsequent fate was, we still\ndidn’t know. Then he told us that he would be going to Petersburg with the next train, where he would\nprepare a flat for us and collect information about my brother. He also explained to us that one of the\nservants who was coming together with Nal was her uncle. He had a large life experience, he was a loyal\nand very educated man.\n\n\nWhile he was talking, he helped me to put the suit of the servant on: a brown jacket with\nsilver buttons, the same long trousers and a cap with silver galloons. Of course, I didn’t become a very\ngood-looking man, but I looked elegant to myself after the black-skinned dirty dervish.\n\nFlorentian put the blue suit and the white silk shirt on. He tied the grey silk tie into the bow-\ntie. In fact – whatever he would put on, he would always look perfectly, as though it wouldn’t be possible\nfor him to look better. He smoothed his curly hair without any mercy, parted it with the parting in the\nmiddle from his forehead down to his neck, put the pince-nez on – and he was still a handsome man.\n\nThe time was passing, it was broad daylight already. We heard the horses snorting, and the\nyard-keeper gave a shout that the cart was already here.\n\n```\nThe master commanded to the yard-keeper silently through the window.\n```\n“Go to our neighbour. If he’s not at home, run to his shop to see him. Remind him that today\nhe promised to deliver two oriental robes and the carpet to his aunt. When I am going to the station, I will\ndrop my night guests to the cattle market on the way. If they want to spend the night at my place in the\nevening again, let them in, even if I am not at home.”\n\nThe yard-keeper ran to the neighbour, and we took our belongings from veranda, which\nseemed to be only a mere show. We took several books from the chests and left them empty in the\ncorridor. Having untied the parcels, we found pillows there. We put the shawls of the parcels in the\nwardrobe.\n\nWe left the house in several minutes. I habituated myself to be a servant, so I was carrying\nmy master’s light coat. I helped him to sit down on the back seat and I settled myself on the front bench.\nThe master sat down on the coachman’s seat and took the reins into his hands. When we crossed the\ngates, I jumped out and closed them. We turned towards the station.\n\nThe city wasn’t awaked yet. The sarths on duty were toiling at their horses here and there,\nbecause the artificial irrigation was always changing its direction, and these people were strictly adjusting\nthe flow by releasing the water now to Bukhara now to Khiva now to Samarkand or somewhere else.\n\nNow we were going quickly, but I had time to observe the houses, gardens and market-\nplaces. The market-places were different from the ones that I had seen in the streets of K. and they didn’t\nremind me at all the market of Bagdad. They looked like big barns, but anyway their style wasn’t European.\nThe number of little shops and all kinds of market-places showed the richness of the city.\n\nIt was my passion to observe everything. I plunged into it again. The motion round us\nbecame more intense, and we left the city, the view simply enchanted me with its flamboyance. I hadn’t\nyet seen a big caravan of the camels; and here from several sides, the caravans were moving to the city in\nlines slowly and with dignity, swinging their loaded humps, guided by the small donkeys on whose backs\nusually a cameleer was riding. The donkeys loaded with fruit, vegetables, fowl and other wealth were\nmoving to the market, pressed one to another and raising dust on all the roads that led to the highroad.\n\nPeaks of the mountains covered with snow were showing white in the distance. The sky was\nsomewhere purple, somewhere violet and green, above us – it was bright blue; a breeze was refreshing us\nbecause of the quick driving – and I exclaimed again.\n\n```\n“What a wonderful life!”\n```\n\nThis exclamation was so unexpected to both of my friends who were delved deeply into their\nthoughts that for the first moment they were only looking at me surprised, but having seen my fascinated\nphysiognomy, they laughed loudly. I also burst out laughing.\n\n```\nWe were close to the station, and my master lord Benedict explained to me in English.\n```\n“A good servant is always serious. He never meddles into his master’s conversation, he\ndoesn’t show his presence in any way and he only answers the questions asked. He is deaf and mute until\nhis master needs his services.”\n\nThe tone of his speech was serious, but a humour was glittering in his eyes. I restrained my\nlaughing, put my hand to the peak of my cap and answered him absolutely seriously and also in English.\n\n```\n“Understood, your highness!”\n```\n“We are approaching the station,” the lord continued. “Here’s a wallet for you. Get out of\nthe cart first and hurry to the booking-office. Buy two tickets in the international carriage to K. We will walk\nslowly to the platform and we will meet there. The train is coming soon. If there are no tickets to the\ninternational carriage, buy first class tickets.”\n\nI took the wallet, jumped out of the cart as soon as we stopped and ran to the booking-\noffice.\n\nI found my master in the platform and informed him that I got the tickets to the international\ncarriage. He nodded his head to the porter with dignity. The porter was holding two elegant suitcases. I\ncouldn’t understand in any way how the suitcases got here, and only later I comprehended that they must\nhave been tied to our cart in advance.\n\n“Here’s the new trouble,” I thought for a while, not knowing what to do with the wallet and\ntickets. Since the train was already coming, I put everything into the inner pocket of my jacket.\n\n“To the international,” I growled out carelessly to the porter and followed him to the very\nend of the platform.\n\nWhen the train stopped, I gave the tickets to the conductor and got into a small two-seater\ncompartment. I put the things together and dismissed the porter. The conductor even swept the floor of\nthe compartment hurriedly, which were clean anyway and cleaned the dust a little. It seemed that he was\njudging about the master’s tip from his servant’s uniform. I jumped out onto the platform to let my master\nknow that everything was ready.\n\nThe second whistle was heard. Lord Benedict and his friend slowly turned towards the\ncarriage, and with the third whistle the kind lord slowly lifted his foot on the footstep of the carriage. I even\nwanted to push him from behind, because I could understand in no way such slowness of his.\n\nHaving said something more to his remaining friend, finally he got on the carriage. Now the\nwhistle of the engine was heard already, so not even waiting until my master is kind to keep going, I bowed\nto our master and jumped into the train that was moving already.\n\nOnly when his friend remaining in the platform couldn’t be seen at all anymore, the lord\nturned round and went to the compartment. The conductor addressed him with some question, but he\nshowed him his face, not understanding anything, and looked at me.\n\n“My master is Englishman,” I explained to him very kindly, “and he doesn’t understand a\nsingle word in any other language. I am his interpreter.”\n\n\nThe conductor repeated his question if we would like to have tea. I translated that to my\nlord, and the conductor received an order for tea, biscuits and two bars of chocolate. In addition I gave him\na large bank-note and asked him to buy the best melon, some apples and pears from the dining-car. Being\ncertain of the future tip, the conductor promised me to buy the fruit not in the train, but in the next station\nwhich was famous for the fruit.\n\nIn several minutes he brought us the tea and lemon, the biscuits and chocolate, closed the\ndoor and we stayed alone.\n\nRegardless of the fallen thick, dark curtain and the ventilator which was spinning under the\nceiling, there was a scorching heat hanging in the carriage. I took my cap off and I was glorifying my light\ncool jacket which was made of the material similar to Chinese silk. My lord took his jacket off and lay down\non the seater. His feet didn’t fit in and they remained hanging.\n\n“My pal, I am very tired. If you have strength, protect my sleep for two or three hours. If I\ndon’t wake up until that time, then wake me up. There will be no possibility to get any sleep later on, and\nwe will still need lots of strengths. Don’t worry that we won’t be discussing all events. When I wake up, we\nwill eat and you will have to go to sleep. Open the little suitcase, you will find there something that was left\nin Ali’s house, what young Ali found when he was putting your clothes in order. That nice friend, whom we\njust said good-bye to, brought these suitcases from Ali to us.”\n\nWith these words he turned to the wall and fell asleep at once. I was sitting, being afraid of\nmaking a move. I decided to open the suitcase only when we reach that station where the conductor\npromised to buy us fruit. I went to the corridor that was in front of our compartment, so I could sit there\nand the knocking of the conductor wouldn’t wake Florentian up.\n\nSeveral men with tired faces in the corridor were cursing heat. They were getting ready to\nget out in this station and buy some fruit. Some of them were darting glances at me, but I buried myself in\nthe book which Florentian had put on the small table in our compartment.\n\nIt was a novel about the period of the middle ages. The beginning of the novel seemed to be\nrather boring, but knowing well that epoch, I decided to get to know its English translation.\n\nThe travellers were gathering together in the landing of the carriage. Some of them had their\nheads covered with a cap, some – with a panama, and some – with an English helmet “hello – good-bye” –\nso this cap with two peaks was called in Russia, - and some had no cover at all. The train came to the\nplatform and stopped.\n\nI opened the window and started observing the crowd... There was more life in this station\nthan in the other ones which I had seen before. The sellers with big baskets of fruit were running in all\ndirections. The figures of women with covers were flashing, they were standing in little groups, but I\ncouldn’t understand in any way what they were doing here. They didn’t sell anything, they only would go\nfrom one place to another one. Respectful sarths of different ages and positions were crowding in several\nplaces and casting glances at the public that was coming. Noisy and boring Jews with their typical half-\nlength coats and black little caps were true contrast to the impressive Orientals.\n\nAll travellers came back to the carriage quickly. Their hands were full of fruit. It seemed to\nme that their purchase was good, but when the train started off, the conductor came to me. He gave me\nthe basket of fruit and even merrily winked at the side of the travellers who were nibbling their apples.\nHaving looked at his purchase, I understood how the real Eastern fruit should look like: the apples were\nhuge, their form was flat or oblong, and they were transparent. One could see every little seed through\n\n\nthem. Yellow pears looked like an amber. There were two small melons. I was feeling dizzy because of their\nscent. Besides, there were wonderful yellow and blue plums in the basket.\n\n“That’s the fruit,” the conductor said to me. “One has to know where to buy and whom to\nsell to. I have a friend here, who prepares two such baskets for me every time when the train is passing by.”\n\nI was delighted with his friend who was growing such fruit. I thanked the conductor, paid him\ngenerously in the name of my master and treated him to an apple.\n\nHe was very pleased with such hospitality of mine. He leant against the wall and started\neating his apple. I tucked away a juicy divine pear. I was trying not to let a single drop of its refreshing juice\nto fall down. The conductor was inviting me to his compartment, but I answered him that my lord was very\nstrict and that he couldn’t manage without my help, because he absolutely didn’t know any other\nlanguages, that I was going to give him the fruit and that both of us were going to sleep. I answered to his\nquestion about our breakfast and dinner that my master was a very noble lord and that lords were dining\nonly to a special order.\n\nI said good-bye to the conductor, thanked him once again and came back to the\ncompartment. I was trying to move as silently as possible, but soon I noticed that Florentian was sleeping\nlike a log, and if I had to wake him up, I really would have failed.\n\nAll muscles of his body were completely relaxed – only animals were resting like this, - and\nhe was breathing so silently that I couldn’t hear him at all. “Well, well,” I thought for a while, “That stupid\ncap of the dervish damaged my hearing, too. I could always hear so perfectly, but now I didn’t hear the\nbreathing of the sleeping man.”\n\n```\nBeing distressed about my lost hearing, I gave a sigh and pulled out the little suitcase.\n```\n\n# Chapter 6\n\n## We don’t come up to K.\n\nIt was so dark in the carriage that I raised the curtain a little and made a little crack. I sat\ndown at the table and tried to open the suitcase. There wasn’t a key, but having turned the locks to all\ndirections, I finally managed to open it, although I had some trouble with it. Carefully rolled boxes with figs,\ndried pressed apricots and dates were placed on top of the suitcase. I took the boxes out and under several\nsheets of clean paper I found the letter addressed to me. The handwriting was unknown to me.\n\nI wasn’t afraid of rustling the paper anymore, because Florentian kept sleeping like a log.\nHaving opened the envelope, first of all I looked at the signature. The following was written there: “Ali\nMachmed”. It was a short letter which started with the usual salutation in the East “Brother”.\n\nYoung Ali was writing that he was sending to me the things that were left in the student\njacket, as well as the replacement shirt and the suit which I would find in the big suitcase and which, of\ncourse, would come in handy to me. Asking to accept everything sincerely as the present, he added that in\nthe little suitcase I would find all writing-materials and some cash from his personal savings, which he was\nbrotherly sharing with me. In another section of this suitcase there were placed only womanly things, cash\nand the letter which he was asking to give to Nal when we first meet, wherever and whenever that would\nhappen.\n\nThen he continued that Ali Mahomet had also put a little parcel which I would find among\nhandkerchiefs. Young friend was asking me very much not to feel shy concerning any financial questions.\nHe was writing that we would see each other soon and that we might need to change our roles.\n\nI was moved very much by such care and friendly tone of the letter. I leant my head on my\nhand and started thinking about young Ali’s life and the wound of his heart. The bluish violet eyes of the\nyouth, his slender figure which was so delicate and slim that one could take him for a girl, his light and\ngraceful step – I was imagining everything very clearly and even felt his charm. I had no doubt that he was\nperfectly educated, and since he was close to old Ali who was full of fire and whose wisdom was flowing\nwith his every look and word, only a noble and intelligent man could be living with him.\n\nI thought for a while that since his childhood the boy Ali was surrounded by the atmosphere\nof fight and action for his nation’s liberation, and that probably, according to his understanding, man’s life\nwas nothing else but an action and fight which would always come to the first place, while his personal life\nwas in the second place. I couldn’t make up my mind in any way how old he was, but I knew that he was\nmuch older than Nal. Visually he was so young that I couldn’t give him more than seventeen.\n\nI read his letter one more time and I didn’t understand again what Ali could find in my\npockets. I started looking for it in the suitcase and, having lifted the towel, I shouted out of astonishment:\nsomething began to shine in the dim compartment, and I recognized the wonderful peacock on the note-\nbook of my brother.\n\nNow I remembered how we were putting in order my brother’s writing-table and how I put\nthis book into my pocket. Having taken it out of the suitcase, I started examining this miracle of jewelry\nwork. The longer I was looking at it the more I was surprised by the subtle and graceful work of the master.\nThe stretched out train of the peacock seemed to be alive and moving because of the brilliance of the\n\n\ngems. Its head, neck and body were made of white enamel and were astonishing me with the proportions\nof forms and harmony. The whole bird was alive!\n\n“How man needs to love his job, to know the anatomy of the bird in order to express it like\nthis!” I thought, while admiring the work. A bitter thought flashed that I was twenty years old already, and I\nstill hadn’t achieved anything in any field, so I could create something to make people’s lives easier or\ndecorate them.\n\nI was still holding the note-book in front of me and I wanted to know its history. Maybe my\nbrother bought it? I drove this thought off instantly, because my brother couldn’t buy such treasure. Maybe\nthis was a present? Who presented it to him?\n\nIn my thoughts I flew away to my brother’s life. I could see myself such short and mysterious\nperiod of it. I connected the figure of the peacock to Ali Mahomet’s head decoration during the feast. There\nwas also a peacock, wasn’t it? It was totally white and made only of big gems. “This bird must be some kind\nof an emblem”, I kept thinking about it. Curiosity was burning me, I was about to open up the note-book\nand read what my brother had written there, but that honour which he had infused in me stopped my\nentire heat. I kissed the note-book and put it back in its place.\n\n“No”, I was thinking, “If you, my brother-father, have any secrets from me, I won’t be reading\nthem until you are alive. Only when life separates us for ever, and I cannot hand this treasure to you, only\nthen I will open it. Until there’s any hope to see you, I will be a loyal protector of your peacock.”\n\nThe heat was simply suffocating me. I ate another juicy pear and decided to look for Ali\nMahomet’s parcel. Soon I found a little pile of elegant handkerchiefs, and there was an envelope among\nthem, in which I could feel a hard square.\n\nI opened the envelope and was dumbfounded... There was a little box with a white peacock\nwrapped in the envelope. It had his train stretched. It wasn’t made of the most precious stones, but of gold\nand even enamel, and the colours of its train were like the ones of the real peacock. The box itself was\nblack, only its brims were studded with small pearls.\n\nI opened the box: its inside was golden, there were white small pills similar to peppermint\npastilles put in it. I put the box aside and started reading the letter.\n\nIt surprised me with its conciseness, the power of expression and an exceptional calm. I am\nkeeping this letter until now, although I haven’t seen Ali Mahomet for twenty years when he left for his\nhomeland.\n\n_“My son,”_ he was writing. _“You’ve chosen your path with your own free will. And this path is\nyour love and loyalty to the one whom you yourself acknowledged as your brother-father. Don’t give up to\nany doubts or hesitations. Don’t ruin your activity with any doubt or sadness. Meet any test cheerfully,\neasily and merrily. Spread your joy to everybody. You’ve chosen the path of work and fight, so walk it by\nasserting, always asserting, and not negating. Never think: “I will fail”, but believe: “I will succeed”. Don’t\nsay to yourself: “I cannot”, but smile to the childishness of this word and say: “I will win”. I am sending you\nthe pills. They give cheerfulness. When you have to concentrate all your strengths or when sleepiness\ntorments you, especially in the stuffy rooms or when you are rocked – swallow one of the pills. Don’t\noverindulge in them, but if one of your friends, and especially your current attendant, asks you to protect his\nsleep, and you feel totally weakened, remember my pills. Always be vigilantly attentive. Love people and\ndon’t blame them, but also remember that the enemy is vicious, he doesn’t drowse and he will always want_\n\n\n_to take advantage of your absent-mindedness and lack of your attention. You’ve chosen that path where\nheroism of feelings and thoughts isn’t a dream, ideal or fantasy, but simply it is your daily activity. I am\nsqueezing your hand. Accept my handshake full of cheerfulness and energy... If some day anxiety gets into\nyour heart – remember me. And let this white peacock become for you an emblem of calm and work for the\nsake of people’s wealth and happiness.”_\n\n```\nThe letter was signed with one letter “M”. I understood that it meant “Mahomet.”\n```\nSince we boarded the carriage, a couple of hours passed, if not more. It seemed that it\ncouldn’t be any hotter. I took my jacket off, unbuttoned the collar of my shirt and still I was feeling that my\neyes were drooping and I was about to faint away. I looked at Florentian. He was still sleeping like a log.\nNothing was left, but only to try the effect of Ali Mahomet’s pills.\n\nI took one of them and started chewing it. Nothing special happened in the beginning, I still\nwanted to go to sleep, but in some time I felt as though light coolness, as though a trembling ran through\nmy nerves, my sleepiness was gone, I was sitting cheerful and totally revived, as though after the shower.\n\nI started examining the part of the suitcase which was assigned to me. I found a puffed out,\ncrammed wallet, some excellent washing requisites and writing-materials. Having admired them for a\nwhile, I put everything in order again and fastened the suitcase, not even peeking at that section where the\nthings assigned to Nal were placed.\n\nAs soon as I started reading the book, there came a light knock on the door of the\ncompartment. Having opened the door, I saw a tall mister in the corridor. He looked like a merchant. He\nasked me in French if somebody from our compartment would like to scatter about his boredom by playing\na game of vint. I answered him that I was only a servant interpreter and that I didn’t know how to play vint,\nand that my mister Englishman didn’t know a single word neither in Russian nor in French and that I had\nnever seen any cards in his hands. The visitor apologized for disturbing us and disappeared.\n\nPerhaps, everything was real and very simple in this situation, and this mister was one of the\ngamblers who could sit at the table of cards during day and night. The kaleidoscope of the last days’ events\nwas stirring up my fancy so much that I seemed to see a spy here, too, and unwillingly I was asking a\nquestion if he wasn’t as much the merchant as I was the servant.\n\n“Great,” I thought for a while, “that would be the last straw if we got to a desert island and\nfound a guardian, for example, captain Nemo. I am living like in the fairy-tale.”\n\nIt would have been better if Florentian hadn’t been sleeping. I couldn’t bear this long silence\nwith its single accompaniment anymore – the creak of the walls and even noise of the wheels.\n\nI read the letter of old Ali one more time. I was imagining his fiery eyes and his tall figure. In\nmy thoughts I thanked him not only for the pills, but also for the words of his letter, which were refreshing\nme. I stroked my wonderful peacock and, like the best friend, I put it in the inner pocket of my jacket, then I\nthrew the jacket on my shoulders.\n\nI wasn’t feeling any pressure in my temples anymore, my pulse was even, and I took the\nbook into my hands, wishing to read it.\n\nI raised the night curtain of the window a little higher and examined the district which we\nwere crossing. Once again there was a hungry steppe, apparently, it wasn’t irrigated. The scorching sun and\nburnt down, bare soil – that’s the whole landscape, for as far as my eyes could take in.\n\n\n“Yes, the God’s grace has avoided this land,” I was thinking to myself, while looking through\nthe window. “Apparently, the people here are painting the domes of the mosques in blue and decorating\ntheir walls in mixed colours, they love striking clothes and carpets, because they want to compensate\nthemselves this greyness of their hungry soil, this yellow dust, in which the camel is dragging himself along\nup to its knees.”\n\nThe train wasn’t going that fast, it would stop seldom. I went deep into the book. The plot of\nthe novel was seizing me a little at a time, I was so plunged in it that I forgot everything around me. I was\nreading for about two hours when I felt that both of my legs and hands had become numb already. I stood\nup and started rubbing them. Soon Florentian gave a start, stretched himself, gave a deep sigh and sat up\nimmediately, as though he would be made of rubber.\n\n“Well, now I had a good sleep,” he said to me. “Thank you very much for protecting me. I see\nthat you are a loyal watchman,” he gave a laugh, flashing his teeth. “But why didn’t you wake me up\nearlier? I must have slept more than four hours.”\n\nAnd I was still standing with my eyes opened wide and I was unable to utter a word, because\nI was so surprised at such a waking up of his.\n\n“I hadn’t seen such strange man as you during my entire life,” finally I uttered. “You are\nsleeping like dead, and you wake up like a cat that sensed a mouse during its sleep. Did I need to wake you\nup? But I aren’t a giant that could stand you up on your feet as you did to me. Even if I had shaken you until\nI’ve fallen down, that could hardly help, too.”\n\n```\nFlorentian was rocking with laughter because of both my physiognomy and my annoyance.\n```\n“Listen, let’s be reconciled,” he proposed. “If I’ve hurt you because I’m sleeping in my own\nway, not as it is accustomed according to the rules of good style, then you, too, admit that you’ve chosen\nnot quite pleasing epithet that would suit well for the good servant of the great master. You could tell\n“tiger”, but no, you told “cat”.”\n\n```\nHe stood up, inspected the fruit and praised me.\n```\n“You are quite a lad! That’s the fruit! One could think that you’ve gathered them in\nCalifornia.”\n\n“Well, I didn’t have enough time to run to California, but I paid the conductor generously for\nthem,” I answered him. “While you were sleeping, our neighbour had dropped in, who’s as if a French\ntrader, and he was inviting us to play vint.”\n\nFlorentian was eating the melon by nodding his head to my reports and suddenly, he noticed\nthe letters which were put on the table.\n\nI read both of them loudly to him. He also asked me where I’ve hidden the box, and when I\nshowed him the inner pocket of my jacket, he explained to me.\n\n“No, that’s not good. There’s a deep, leather pocket on the right side of your trousers, from\ninside. Put it there.”\n\nI felt the pocket on the right side, close to my waist, and I put the box in it. Florentian bent at\nthe window, examined the district and told me.\n\n\n“Soon we’ll reach a big station. See the trees over there – that’s the station already. You will\nhave to get out, stretch your legs and buy some newspapers. Buy all of them, whatever you can find, not\nonly Russian ones, but also the local ones.”\n\n```\nI put my jacket on, hid the letters in the book and I was already about to go.\n```\n```\n“Wait a little, do you want to save the letters?” Florentian asked me.\n```\n```\n“Yes, of course,” I answered him.\n```\n“Then hide them in the suitcase. And not only now, when we are being followed, but never\nleave an unhidden letter in the future, too. It is the best to keep everything in your head and your heart,\nbut not on the paper.”\n\nI hid the letters and left the compartment, because the train was slowing down already and\ncoming to the platform.\n\n```\n“Just in case, ask if there’s a telegram post restante for the lord Benedict,” Florentian added.\n```\nI put my hand at the peak of my cap and hurried like a zealous servant to fulfil my master’s\ncommand. Having met the conductor, I inquired him where the newspapers were sold, in which platform\nthere was a telegraph, and if the train was going to stand here for a long time. The conductor explained to\nme everything in detail. He was sorry that he couldn’t come with me, because this was a big station and\nthere were many travellers. He told me that the train was going to stand for twenty minutes, and that I\ncould be in no hurry.\n\nAs soon as the train stopped, I jumped onto the platform. There were lots of people. Guttural\nshrieks and noise of the crowd which was boarding was mixing with the jokes and loud laughter of the\ntravellers who were pouring out of all carriages. The people were sunburnt and dusky-faced. They were\npushing one another. They were carrying all sorts of bottes, tea-pots and jugs.\n\nThe heat was blazing down here, too, but after the stuffiness of the carriage the weather\nseemed simply wonderful to me.\n\nHaving called at the telegraph, I received two telegrams for my master, I bought a pile of\nnewspapers whatever I could find and I came back to the carriage. As soon as I boarded I met two new\ntravellers. One of them had Eastern clothes on and seemed to be quite handsome man with tender\nexpression. Another one had a white jacket of the road engineer and uniform cap on. He was short, his face\nwas meaningless and tortured by the heat.\n\nI entered our compartment and gave everything to Florentian. He read the telegrams and\nheld them out to me. In the beginning I didn’t understand anything, until it turned out that English words\nwere written in Russian letters on them. It was written in one of them that the horses would be waiting for\nus in the station P. It was written in another one that two houses flamed up in K. The cause was unknown,\nthe people and cattle were saved.\n\nI looked at Florentian who was reading a local newspaper. It was delivered in the morning\nfrom K. It was written in it about the fire at Ali’s place, which also spread to the captain T.’s house, leaving\nonly ashes. The messenger alone managed to escape, while captain T. himself, his brother and the limping\nold man trader couldn’t jump over the wall of the flame, because the old, dry housed flamed up instantly\nfrom all sides like a cardboard. In addition, there also was a stock of petrol in the house, which flew out in\nthe air in the colossal columns of fire.\n\n\nFlorentian translated this message to me and added that, according to the telegrams,\neverything was getting on well for us until now. They had agreed with Ali that if we got revealed in this\ntrain, then Ali Mahomet would send us horses to the station P. from his farm-stead. We’ll get out there\nand, having driven one station back, we’ll board the train to Moscow. We received the telegram, and P. was\nclose already.\n\nMy heart was troubled. A thought was bothering me that my brother could come back and\nget in danger. I let it out to Florentian.\n\n```\nMy friend’s face was very serious.\n```\n“You already know that your brother is in danger. The threat of religious fanaticism will be\nhanging over their heads all the time, until they board the ship and reach London. What is real is that at\nleast he isn’t in K., as you weren’t there, too, during the fire. Let’s not waste our energy in vain for all kinds\nof phantasies and notions, but let’s accumulate it, so that being full of self-control, we could give the part of\nour help to the fugitives. Now you will have to organize our dinner. Give an additional tip to the conductor\nand ask him permission to meet the cook of the dining-car. Order a vegetarian dinner for your eccentric\nmaster, but ask him to serve the dinner here and not later than in one hour. Soon you will be tired, you\nhave to eat and have a good sleep. We’ll have to cover those thirty versts in a very short period of time. The\nhorses will be perfect, I guess the cart will bear us, only your health is poor.”\n\n“Although I’m thin and short, but I’m tough. From my childhood my brother has tempered\nand trained me. Several times I went with him to the field camps, I even went to one trip, so it is easy for\nme to ride even forty versts. If I fainted away and if I often feel unwell, this is only because of the unusual\nheat, but Ali’s pills will help me. Don’t think about me, your terrible sleep worries me more, because if you\nfeel asleep in the cart like you did it here, then until one wakes you up, one could really be burnt down.”\n\n```\nFlorentian burst out laughing merrily again.\n```\n“Nevertheless, how you’ve been intimidated by my heroic sleep! Well, I’ll have to ask you for\none of Ali’s pills and not to sleep like that again.”\n\n“You have your own pills. Ali gave you that little box, from which he was feeding me in his\nstudy,” I answered him, joking.\n\n“I do have it, but you’ve already eaten one pill from that box at my friend’s, so it follows that\nyou owe me.”\n\nHaving laughed some more at my stinginess, he told me that to all those questions about Ali\nand the imaginary dervish, which he’s been reading in my eyes for a long time, he would answer me only in\nMoscow.\n\nI left to take care of the dinner. Generous cash did everything itself, and in an hour a folding-\ntable was already standing in our compartment, while the man-servant from the dining-car was bringing us\nwonderful vegetarian dishes. My master asked him to render thanks to the cook both in monetary and\nverbal way and to give the conductor to eat.\n\nAfter the dinner was over, I fulfilled the last assignment of my master. I told the conductor\nthat the telegram to my lord told him about the possible great deal in station P., that he would wake us up\nin advance and would help me to take our belongings onto the platform. He was glad that he could help us\nfor the wonderful dinner and kept repeating that such great and lucrative travellers were a rarity.\n\n\nHaving entered the compartment, I found the bed that was already prepared for me by\nFlorentian – he had taken a soft pillow from the big suitcase. I was even moved to tears by such a care of\nhis. I remembered that he was sleeping with his head put right on the setee and I reproached him a little.\n\n“But why so much care? I could also sleep like you did and I doubt if I am going to fall asleep\nat all. My nerves are irritated, and a trap seems to me everywhere.”\n\n“It’s all right! I will give you some drops, your irritation will be gone, and you will fall asleep,\nnot worse than I did.”\n\nWhile he was talking like this, he took a little bottle out of his waistcoat and poured some\ndrops into the water.\n\n“Homoeopathy. I don’t believe in it very much,” I answered him, but I drank the water\nanyway and I lay down.\n\n```\nI still could hear the laughter of Florentian and then I dived in some abyss...\n```\nI woke up because of a knock at the door as it seemed to me, but in fact that was Florentian\nwho was waking me up. This time I woke up easily, I was feeling rested perfectly. As soon as I got up, the\nreal knock at the door was heard. Having looked at the corridor, I saw the conductor who had come to\nannounce that we would reach P. in twenty minutes, that I should pick our belongings up and he would\ntake them onto that landing, because the train would stop there only for eight minutes.\n\nI didn’t need to pick our belongings up, because Florentian had already put everything in\norder, and while I was talking to the conductor and dressing myself, he even put the pillow and bedsheet in\nplace. He had already put another suit on and told me to put a light bright suit on the same clothes that I\nalready had on, and instead of my cap I had to put a panama hat on. He also threw black cloaks which were\nsimilar to the ones of the naval officers on top of both himself and myself.\n\nAs soon as the train stopped, both of us, me and the conductor, brought our things onto the\nplatform. One of the travellers from the carriage called the conductor, he squeezed my hand hurriedly and\nran back.\n\nThis time the whole Florentian’s slowness was gone. He took his travelling-bag and big\nsuitcase quickly and gave the smaller suitcase to me. I seized his hand, and we walked not into the hall, but\ntotally sideways, towards the water supply tower, going round the little garden of the station. As soon as\nwe turned behind it, two dervishes jumped out from the opposite side of the garden. They were looking\nround in the dark of the night. A sarth came running to them from the platform and, having said something\nquickly to them, he shoved the tickets into their hands. All three of them rushed to the train with all their\nmight and managed to jump into the last carriage with great difficulty, because the train had already\nmoved.\n\nWe were standing behind the tower in silence. Florentian was strongly squeezing my hand.\nWe waited a little, until the train was gone. When everything around calmed down, he told me silently.\n\n“We must cover a half of the verst very quickly. Take my travelling-bag, give me your suitcase\nand hold my hand tight.”\n\n```\nI wanted to contradict him, but he whispered.\n```\n“Don’t say a word. Quickly. We are in great danger. Be strong. If we are in time for the\nMoscow train, then we will foul the trail.”\n\n\nWe went to the right of the station. The darkness round us was totally black. We were\nwalking not along the road, but along a narrow path, and so quickly that I was almost running, while\nFlorentian was pacing with his long legs, not feeling any weight of the suitcases, not noticing my running.\n\nWe were hurrying like this for about twenty minutes, and suddenly somebody called us. My\nfriend answered him, and I discerned the silhouettes of the horses and the wheels in the darkness. The\ncoach-man took the big suitcase, Florentian pushed me into the light carriage, he jumped in when we were\nalready moving, and we dashed off. I had to ride many times since then – both with the trotters and the\nhorses of the firemen, - but I still haven’t forgotten that mad running, that black night and, apparently, I will\nnever forget it.\n\nI had to take my panama hat off instantly, the wind was howling in my ears, the horses were\ngalloping like a whirlwind. I lost any keenness of my wit. Only Florentian’s words couldn’t get out of my\nhead and that “be strong” of his had pierced my heart. We were scuttling like this for about an hour. The\nhorses were snorting badly and running slower already. The houses and trees flashed, and all of a sudden\nwe stopped.\n\n```\n“Disaster,” I still had time to think a little.\n```\nFlorentian jumped out, seized the suitcases, took me out of the carriage with the travelling-\nbag like a child and commanded in English.\n\n```\n“Quickly. Grab my hand.”\n```\nWe ran across a yard and, having seen a light carriage on the other side, we got into it in a\nflash. The coach-man gave a shout, and we dived into the darkness once again.\n\nFlorentian asked the coach-man about something, and he answered him in a calming way.\nHe was dressed in Eastern way, and I was angry with myself, because I didn’t know so many foreign\nlanguages.\n\n“I’m not deaf, I’m not mute, but it turns out that I’m both deaf and mute,” I was thinking so\nand I made a vow right there that I would learn that ill-fated Eastern language.\n\n“It’s nothing!” Florentian said to me, squeezing my hand tenderly and as if reading my mind.\n“What do you care for? You can learn a hundred languages more. Soon we’ll arrive. The coach-man told me\nthat the tickets are already waiting for us in another kishlak and that we’ll be in the station five minutes\nbefore arrival of the train.”\n\nThe horses kept dashing, and if Florentian hadn’t held me by my waist with his strong hand,\nthen the first stronger shake would have knocked me down out of this light carriage.\n\nSoon the houses glimpsed, at one of them the horses started running a little slower, and\nfrom my side a human figure jumped onto the foot-board. I jumped back out of unexpectedness, but\nhaving seen his smiling face, I understood that he was our friend. The stranger quickly took the seat on the\nrim, he gave an envelope to Florentian and tattled something merrily to him, apparently about the cause of\nhis laughter. Soon he jumped out of the light carriage which was still running at the same speed and\nvanished in the darkness.\n\n“Here are the tickets. We can see the station already,” Florentian explained to me. “We were\nrunning like this for almost two hours. Here are the lights of the station. Remember that now you aren’t my\nservant anymore, but my cousin. My Russian is poor, because I was raised and educated in London, and you\n\n\nare my guide and assistant in all my affairs, I cannot manage without your help. We will be speaking only\nEnglish among ourselves.”\n\nWe arrived at the station. We sincerely thanked our coach-man. As soon as we stepped onto\nthe platform, the train’s whistle was heard.\n\nWe had first class tickets. The carriage seemed to be empty, but perhaps everybody was\nsleeping. Our four-seated compartment was empty, too. The conductor was sleeping. He didn’t even ask us\nto show him our tickets and left all boarding worries to ourselves. It seemed to me that he wasn’t\nabsolutely sober and wanted to hide it from us.\n\nTo my remark about the strange behaviour of the conductor Florentian answered that every\ncloud had a silver lining, because our tickets were valid starting from the next station. We should explain\nthis to him if he was sober, make arrangements about it, and now he won’t even remember where we\nboarded the train.\n\nHaving put our things, we locked the compartment and stretched ourselves on the sofas\nwhich were upholstered with red velvet. Florentian explained to me that he won’t be sleeping, because he\nneeded to read the letter and reconsider something. I was thinking that I also wouldn’t sleep, I wanted to\nhear about the causes of this night’s difficulties, but soon I fell deeply asleep, not even finding time for any\nquestion.\n\nThe rest of the night didn’t give any surprises. In the morning I woke up brisk and first of all I\nsaw the smiling, dear face of my friend. I was feeling so happy that I didn’t see him strict or worried, but\nnice and loving! It seemed to me again that I knew him for a very long time...\n\n“Indeed,” I gave a shout, “I could even argue that I knew you for a very long time! Being close\nto you I feel such love, self-confidence and determination that I would like to share your activities and\ndanger with you, to follow you during my entire life. Now I cannot even imagine my life without you!”\n\nFlorentian laughed, thanked for my love and friendship and told me that his life wasn’t only\ndifficulties, fight and danger, that he would be glad to share it with me if I really wanted to live close to him.\n\nIt was eight o’clock. The sun up in the sky kept burning. We couldn’t see the hungry steppe\nanymore, but the grass, although it was burnt out. Settlements could be seen more and more often. Tents\nof Kirghiz or Kalmyk wanderers were sticking up by every little lake and river, but I was unable to discern\nthe form of their lodgings.\n\n“Life still exists here,” Florentian noticed. “At night we’ll reach the zone of the deserts and\nwe’ll be driving down it for more than twenty-four hours. People are living here in misery. Mostly those are\nthe families of the railwaymen. Quicksand doesn’t give them any hope to have a kitchen-garden or a\ngarden. The water from the wells of the stations is salty, it isn’t suitable neither for drinking nor for\nwatering. The drinking water is brought here in the tanks, but this is far from being enough, so these\nunlucky persons are stealing it one from another, and there’s always the sand which is squeaking between\ntheir teeth.”\n\nI could imagine such way of living and I thought for a while – how much difficulties we still\nhave to overcome, so that life would become fairly good for everybody, still how far our dreams were\nabout equality, brotherhood and satisfaction of everyone’s most necessary needs.\n\nThere came a knock at our door. That was the conductor. He apologized for not taking our\ntickets at night, which always had to be with him, because there would be an inspection soon.\n\n\n```\nFlorentian gave him our tickets.\n```\n```\n“Breakfast, tea,” my friend asked him with a foreign accent.\n```\nI explained him that my brother wanted to eat in the compartment, and not in the dining-\ncar. The conductor volunteered to bring us the breakfast himself and added that a great dining-car would\nbe coupled only in Samara, and now their food was rather poor. To my question about fruit he answered\nthat he could get it and it was quite good.\n\nI gave him some cash. I was thinking how much of it he would spend on drink. I decided that\nuntil we reach Moscow our journey would not be decorated with a high service culture and I doubted\nwhether the breakfast would be edible at all.\n\nI was wrong. The conductor who overslept turned out to be honest. Soon he brought us an\nexcellent coffee with cream, some appetizing bread, butter, cheese, fruit and the whole change to the last\npenny.\n\n```\nWhen we finished our breakfast and cleared the table, Florentian started a serious speech.\n```\n“Now get ready to hear me out what danger we have escaped and what storm is gathering\nabove Ali’s head. The people with dervish clothes and that third one with the tickets, whom we met at\nnight by the water supply tower, were chasing us. With the help of abundant monastic sects and\norganizations of espionage, which unite them, fanatics and mullahs tracked us down. The sarth with the\ntickets, who came running to the dervishes, told them that we were travelling to K. in an international\ncarriage, that you had a servant’s clothes and that you should be killed in the crowd of the platform in K.\nWhen there’s a scandal because of the murder, they had to try to take me alive. Now they are approaching\nK. In that station where we got out, they had already checked everything and they were sure that we\nweren’t there anymore. They have been spying upon Ali’s farm-stead all day long. Having made certain that\nwe weren’t there, too, they asked the coach-man to take them to the station, so that they would be in time\nto catch the night train. He agreed with pleasure, because otherwise he wouldn’t have managed to get\nthere because of us, so that he wouldn’t arouse their suspicion. Having brought them to the station, he\nturned as though towards home at once, but actually, he was waiting for us in the place which Ali indicated\nin his telegram. And now we fouled the trail so much that it is difficult for them to track us down.\nNevertheless, they are looking for two of us, so we have to send telegrams to two of my friends, so that\nthey could join us as soon as possible, while we are still in this train.”\n\nI volunteered to send the telegrams, but Florentian explained to me that this had to be\nassigned to the conductor.\n\n```\nGiving the telegrams and cash to the conductor, Florentian told him.\n```\n“Keep for yourself what is left after you send out the telegrams.” And, having held his callous\nhand in his wonderful palm, he added silently and sincerely. “Only don’t drink anymore. This won’t ease\nyour pain, but only will call even more disasters.”\n\nAnd then an unseen thing happened: the conductor seized Florentian’s hand, buried himself\nin it and burst into tears. This touching lament was breaking my heart. I could hardly suppress my own\ntears.\n\nFlorentian helped the conductor to sit down next to him on the sofa. He mopped his tears\nwith a wonderful, sweet-scented handkerchief and told him.\n\n\n“Don’t grieve, your girl is dead, but your wife is alive. Both of you are young and you will\nhave more children, but you have to live in such a way that your children would be born healthy, so don’t\ndrink anymore. The children of alcoholics are always sickly and unhappy most of the time.”\n\nHaving poured some drops, he gave him the glass of water. When the conductor calmed\ndown, he began to speak.\n\n“I wasn’t drinking up to now, but when I came back home and saw my dead baby and wife,\nand I even didn’t have any time, because I had to go – so I didn’t refrain and started drinking on my way in\nthe train. I told you, mister, about my misfortune this night. Everything got mixed in my head. I was thinking\nthat I was talking to an Asiatic. Such person was walking in the carriage, looking for his friend servant in\nbrown uniform. He didn’t want to believe me in any way that such man wasn’t travelling here. I’ve mixed\neverything up. It seemed to me that he went into the international carriage, and I fell into a light slumber\nfor five minutes, but it turns out that I overslept two stations. It’s okay that the inspector didn’t board at\nthe time. Oh, how a drunk person is mixing everything up. I was thinking that I was telling my story to that\nperson,” he was shaking his head out of astonishment. “What a sin! In this way one can start seeing\nghosts.”\n\nFlorentian squeezed his hand once again and assured him that his wife had only fainted\naway, and sometimes this happens during a child-birth. He advised him to send home a telegram by paying\nthe response to Samarkand at once poste restante.\n\n“So you, mister, are a doctor. One can see that at once. Only a doctor may be human with\neverybody, although that one may be poor. You didn’t show any pride and squeezed my hand,” the\nconductor was speaking like this, while neatly folding and returning the handkerchief to Florentian.\n\n“Keep it as a keepsake about our meeting. When you come back, give this to your wife. Let\nher drink one drop of it before every meal. When she’s drunk all drops, she will fully recover. And let her\nkeep this small bottle as a keepsake about the doctor. When your life becomes difficult, look at the small\nbottle, hold the handkerchief in your hand and think about my words how I was asking you not to drink\nanymore.”\n\n```\nHe squeezed the hand of the conductor once again, held it for a while, smiled and added.\n```\n“We’ll meet again. Be strong. A drunk man – isn’t a man, but a two-legged animal. Don’t\ngrieve that you’ve lost your baby, but be glad that your beloved wife is alive. Run, we are coming to the\nstation.”\n\nThe conductor left, we remained alone. I was in low spirits. I knew perfectly that Florentian\ndidn’t talk to the conductor. How could he know about his misfortune, about his wife? A kind of grievance,\nirritation was growing in me – again those hated secrets!\n\n“Lovushka, don’t be angry,” Florentian said to me, putting his arm round my shoulders\ntenderly. “There aren’t any secrets in the world, I can explain to you everything very simply. At night I went\ninto the corridor and I could hear – someone was crying, simply weeping. I turned towards that direction\nand found that unlucky person, sitting in front of the bottle of vodka, to which he was complaining and\npouring his paid because of his dead wife and baby. One doesn’t have to be a doctor in order to know that\na woman who is ill with kidneys and who is giving birth to a baby may lose her consciousness for a long\ntime. I believe that this is exactly the case and that his wife has recovered, but the poor person didn’t have\ntime to make sure that she was alive. You aren’t a child anymore,” he continued by seating me next to\nhimself. “You have to forget your habit to be vexed when you don’t understand something. If you hadn’t\nbeen irritated, but if you only had concentrated your will and observed everything what seemed to you to\n\n\nbe secret or inconceivable miracles during these days, you would have made sure yourself that there were\nno miracles, but there was only one or another level of knowledge.”\n\nBoth his voice and expression of his nice eyes – everything was so fatherly sweet and tender\nthat I snuggled to him, and again the wave of joy, self-confidence and peace ran through me. I was happy.\n\nThe conductor came back quickly. He brought us the receipts of the telegrams sent and a\nbunch of flowers which he used for decorating our little table. Florentian told him that in Samara he was\nwaiting for two of his friends to board the train. He asked him to leave the adjacent free compartment for\nus and to take all four places in our compartment, so that he could rest as befits him. The conductor\nexplained to us that if we pay for the remaining two places, then we’ll have the right to the whole\ncompartment, and if we order the places for our friends starting from Samara, then we’ll have to pay in\nadvance both for the order and for the tickets. We did exactly so.\n\nWe kept travelling nicely. We had to arrive to Samara at night. I was very tired, I wanted to\nsleep and asked the conductor to lay the bed for me. Florentian told me that he would be waiting for his\nfriends and he didn’t take the bedding, but asked the conductor to lay the bed in the adjacent\ncompartment.\n\nI asked the conductor why our carriage was so empty. He explained to me that now\neverybody was going to the fair in the depth of the country and that the trains to those directions were\ncrowded with the traders from the whole world, so they were coming back from there empty, but in two\nweeks one couldn’t get even a third class return ticket.\n\nMy bed was already ready. I washed myself as befitted me and changed into a clean linen\nwith joy. In my thoughts I thanked Ali Machmed for it and promised not to leave indebted to him for taking\ncare of me. I wished good night to Florentian and fell asleep at once.\n\n\n# Chapter 7\n\n## New friends\n\nHaving woken up, I saw that Florentian was gone. Apparently, there was rather late morning\nalready; suddenly I was surprised by the big and clear raindrops that were knocking at the windows. That\nwas the first rain since that time when I came to my brother’s to K. It never rains in summer there, and one,\nbeing stuck round with dust and sweat, is dreaming of such raindrops as of manna from heaven.\n\nI jumped to my feet immediately and started laughing, remembering how I was amazed by\nthe sudden moves of Florentian when he sat up just like I did after waking up. I dashed to the window like a\ncat to the mouse and I drew the curtain back.\n\nThe rain seemed to me no stranger and nice. A forest, the real green forest, was looming\nthrough the grey rain’s veil, and the heat was gone.\n\nI sensed a tender feeling for my motherland, as if a remorse, that I had valued her so poorly\nup to now – its forests, green water-meadows, grasslands of lush grass... I was happy that I got to my own\nland, that there was no that greyish yellow landscape, no those blue domes and minarets of the mosques,\nwhich were bulging like the mountains.\n\nAs soon as this thought flashed in my imagination, the train of the last days’ events, people,\nseparate words and episodes came to the surface instantly.\n\nMy joy faded away, my movements became sluggish. I started dressing myself slowly and I\nwas thinking what kind of salad had mixed in my head. I was unable to relate all events consistently in any\nway: what had happened yesterday, today or three days ago – everything was tied into one big knot, and I\nwas unable to pull anything out of my memory.\n\nSuddenly my ear caught a word that flew in from the corridor, and the timbre of the voice\nseemed to be familiar again.\n\n“It’s strange,” I thought for a while. “I could always remember faces and voices so well, but\nnow it seemed that I’d lost that gift, too. The damned cap of the dervish and the heat must have damaged\nnot only my hearing, but my brain, too.”\n\nAt that moment a baritone of unique beauty was heard again. I even sat up out of\namazement, the sweat stood out on my face due to the heat, although it was pretty chilly in the\ncompartment.\n\n“I really got out of order, as the messenger of my brother used to say,” I continued my\nthought by wiping the sweat off my forehead. “That dervish couldn’t get here, could he? The one who gave\nme his clothes and whom we had stopped at in the night.” My head was spinning so much because of\neverything that I could feel nausea which was seizing me even physically.\n\nI thought for a while that now even in the presence of death penalty I wouldn’t be able to tell\nabout all events, because my mind refused any logical thinking. I was sitting sadly, hanging my head down,\nwhile in the corridor I could distinguish two voices already, which were speaking in English. One of the\nvoices was Florentian’s, and another one – the same wonderful metal baritone, smoothing and soft, but it\nseemed that if only temperament was given to this voice, then it would become severe like an element.\n\n\n“I cannot be such lost little child. I must go and make sure whom Florentian is speaking to.”\nWhile thinking like this, I was trying to grasp in vain when we parted with the imaginary dervish, how much\ntime had passed since that moment, if he could have time to get here.\n\nAs soon as I decided to leave our compartment, the door opened and Florentian entered. His\nwonderful face was fresh as one of a youth, his eyes were shining, a smile was playing in his lips – I would\nhave gazed at this incarnation of energy and kindness and I would have never believed how strictly serious\nhe could be sometimes.\n\nFrom the expression of my embarrassed face he as though read all my thoughts, took a seat\nnext to me, embraced me and told tenderly.\n\n“My dear boy! All these events of the last days could also violate not so delicate organism\nlike yours, but everything that you had to experience, you have withstood heroically. Fear or a thought\nabout the danger threatening you didn’t disturb your heart at least one time. You were so loyal, you were\nstriving to save your brother as much as possible. Now I know already what is the fate of Ali and his family.”\n\nAnd he told me how Ali and his nephew came back to the town after he saw us and the\ndervish off. First of all he led all people out of his house and hid them in a deep concrete cellar below a\nstone barn in the very depth of the garden. He also brought some more valuable carpets and other things\nhere. He disguised the entrance, so that nobody could find them. In this way Ali and his family spent the\nterrible night in the deep cellar, because the whole crowd of dervishes and muslims were playing the\nmaster above them.\n\nFlorentian didn’t tell me in detail about the inevitable terror during such events. The\ngovernment, having found out that the massacre was taking a large scale, - and that wasn’t included in its\nplans, - sent the patrols across the entire town, but the patrols started their job only when Ali’s house was\nalready set on fire from all sides.\n\nThe fanatics did the same to your brother’s house. The old and dry like a chip house soon\nturned into ashes. But here the misfortune was bigger. The bribed messenger let some people into the\nhouse in the evening – as if to take a look at your brother’s library. They tried to treat him to some wine,\nand it turned out that he liked it very much, so they had a good time. Nobody knows exactly what\nhappened next, but the fact is that the messenger jumped out of the burning house through the window,\nand the visitors burnt down. When he jumped through the window, its frame injured his head. A patrol\nwho was going by found him when he was running through the little gates of the garden. He was half-\nnaked, blood-stained and in shock. The patrol took him to the hospital. The messenger was raving and kept\nrepeating.\n\n“Captain... master... brother... They tried to break in,” – and then again. “Captain... master...\nbrother... I didn’t let them in... they set in on fire...”\n\nThe medical officer, having found out from the soldiers that they knew the patient, that he\nwas the messenger of captain T., became worried and sent someone to inform the general of the fire in the\ncaptain T.’s house. He also ordered to tell the general that nobody knew where captain T. was, perhaps he\nand his brother burnt down in the fire; that he didn’t manage to find out something more from the\nmessenger, and it seemed that he would die, without recovering his consciousness.\n\nAwakened general who was ill disposed towards the local people and who didn’t like if his\nnight rest was disturbed dashed off to the governor. He arranged such a show over there that everybody\nwas awakened instantly. Haven’t seen or heard anything up to now, having considered the religious\n\n\nquestions of the locals not to be worth of any attention of the czar’s authority, the officers began to see\nthings clearly and started to put out the fire of religious fanaticism by declaring the massacre to be a riot.\n\nHaving paid authority for not interfering in their affairs, the raging crowd of fanatics was\nsurprised when they saw the fire-brigade and a troop of the army. The mullah was persuading the\ndervishes and the crowd that it was only a dramatization, that nobody would touch them, but having seen\nthe soldiers formed and ready to shoot, he was the first who started running, and after him the whole wild\ncrowd ran away in all directions.\n\nAli’s house was partly saved, but my brother’s house was burning like a bonfire, the flame\nwas raging so much that it was impossible even to come nearer to it. It seemed that from the ravings of the\npoor messenger an opinion was formed that captain T. and his brother burnt down with the house.\n\nWhile Florentian was telling me about all of it, a single thought was tormenting me: “Whose\nvoice did I hear? What’s the name of that man?”\n\nNot for the first time during our short acquaintance, I was surprised by the stunning ability of\nFlorentian to answer the questions that I was asking in my thoughts. And now, too, he explained to me that\nin Samara two of his friends boarded our carriage, whom he greeted on the platform.\n\n“You already know one of them,” he uttered these words with such unique humour, he\nblinked an eye at me so comically that I burst out laughing. “He’s an Indian and his name is Sandra Kon-\nAnanda. You aren’t mistaken by deciding that many singers could dream about such voice. He sings\namazingly, he knows music perfectly, and here you will have a lots in common, if you aren’t attracted by\nother characteristics of this peculiar, interesting and well educated man. My other friend is Greek. He’s also\nan extraordinary man. He’s a great mathematician, but his character is more complicated: he’s gone deep\ninto his science and he’s less associative, sometimes he’s strict and even stinging. Don’t worry if he keeps\nsilent; he isn’t talking much, but he’s kind-hearted, he has suffered a lot and he’s ready to help everybody\nin his misfortune. Don’t draw a conclusion according to his appearance. If you want to talk to him,\novercome your shyness and address him like you’re addressing me.”\n\n“Like I’m addressing you!” I gave a shout, being even excited. “But can anybody be equal to\nyou? Even if there were thousands of wonderful people drawn up in front of me and I was offered to\nchoose a friend, a guardian, a brother – I wouldn’t like anybody else, but you. And now, when everything\nwhat was dear and close to me – my brother – is in danger, when I don’t even know when I would see him\nagain, whether I save myself, I’m glad with life only because I’m next to you. The whole new horizons open\nup for me through you and in you, as though everything would take another meaning. Only now I\nunderstood that life’s value and beauty – that’s not only love to those with whom we are connected\nthrough the bonds of our blood, but joy to live and fight for happiness and freedom of all people. And I\nunderstood this only by staying next to you. What would have happened to me during all those days if you\nhadn’t been next to me? It is unimportant that I would have died from the hand of a fanatic, but only that is\nimportant that I would have left my life not living a single day without fear, not grasping what happiness is\nto live when fear isn’t squeezing my heart. And I understood that only by staying next to you. Now I know\nthat life is leading everybody to such altitudes to which the perception of his own work as a work-joy, as a\nwork-sincere help can rise, so that the darkness round him would be overcome with joy. All coincidences\nwhich pushed me into the vortex of the passions now seem to me like blessed, and they happened only\nbecause I could have met you. And nobody, nobody in the world could be equal to you in my heart!”\n\nFlorentian was listening to my passionate speech in silence; his eyes were smiling kindly, but\nI could see in them a shadow of sadness and compassion.\n\n\n“I’m very happy, my dear friend, that you have evaluated our meeting and my presence next\nto you so much,” Florentian was talking to me with his hand placed on my head. “This proves that you\npossess a sense of gratitude, which is a rarity among people. Only don’t be excited. If your consciousness\nhas widened during these days, then certainly your heart should have opened up, too. The limits of\nconditionalities should have disappeared both in your heart and your thoughts. Now you should look at\nevery man with absolutely different eyes, searching in him not for what everybody can see at once, not for\nstriking characteristics of his mind, his beauty, wit or anger, but for his inner strength and kindness of his\nheart, which only may become the light for all surrounding people who are buried in the darkness of their\nsuperstitions and passions. If you want to carry the light and freedom to people’s lives, then start looking at\nthem in a new way. Start to distinguish vigilantly the differences between the poor and accidental in man\nand between his great qualities which were born in his work, fight and entire chain of victories against\nhimself. Start now, not tomorrow. Reject the superstition that man is such as he looks like, but make a\ndecision about him only from his acts, always trying to enter his situation and to find a justification for him.\n\nBoth of my friends hardly know your brother and Nal, but as soon as Ali mentioned such\npossible outcome a month ago, both of them quitted all their affairs and as soon as they received an\ninvitation they came to help Ali, and so did I. Try to look at their faces differently for the first time. Let love\nto your brother become the key to your new perception of man’s heart. With help of this key, comprehend\nthat power of loyal love which is uniting all people, independent of their nationality, belief or class\ndifferences. See only people in them for the first time, whose colour of blood is the same red as yours.”\n\nHe embraced me and explained that they with Sandra Kon-Ananda have already drunk the\ncoffee in the dining-car, and now I should be polite and offer my service to another guest. Greek’s name\nwas – Ilofilion. His Russian is poor and he feels shy to talk in the surroundings which are unusual to him.\n\n“Overcome your shyness,” Florentian added, “remember how I was leading you by the hand\nin the most difficult moments of your life. Imagine that those are unpleasant minutes for him, too, and help\nhim. He’s speaking German perfectly. If you are tired of his efforts to communicate with you in your native\nlanguage, ask him to tell you in German about his student life. He graduated the faculty of nature in\nuniversity of Heidelberg and the one of mathematics in London.”\n\nWith these words he suggested to tidy myself up. He took a cap from the travelling-bag and\nput in on my head instead of the panama. Having sighed deeply, I left to become acquainted with the Greek\nwho was no less shy than myself.\n\nI hadn’t the honour to be in society many times during twenty years of my life. I was living\nwith my brother for fourteen years without a separation. I was learning according to the program of the\nsecondary school, and my brother was guiding me. That was a nomadic life. I even participated in R.’s deed,\nbut when my brother’s regiment was transferred to the Middle East, he decided to send me to the\nsecondary school of Petersburg where our aunt was living. He was hoping to settle me at her place, but the\nold puffed-up lady didn’t want such a sullen companion like myself, and my brother had to search for a\nboarding-school.\n\nDuring my entrance examination to the sixth grade, the level of my knowledge surprised the\nteachers. I passed an examination of languages and mathematics perfectly and I stunned everybody with\nmy written work about a fairy-tale in the creative work of the great writers. The subject was given from the\nRussian literature, and I understood it on a scale of the worldwide literature and, with the passion\ncharacteristic to me, I wrote so much that I ran out of paper. When I asked the teacher for some extra\npaper, he answered to me in amazement that this was the first such case during his entire life that a\nschoolboy would need more paper which was meant for both the rough and clean copy.\n\n\nHe showed my work to the principal who approached us at that time and explained to him\nthat I had been writing my work for nearly three hours already, without stopping. The principal started\nreading my written work, he read over nearly every sheet of paper and asked me, looking intently.\n\n```\n“Are you a son of a writer?”\n```\n```\n“No,” I answered him, “I’m the son of my brother.”\n```\nHaving noticed stunned both the principal and the teacher, how the teacher could hardly\nrestrain his laughter, I became totally lost and babbled.\n\n“Excuse me, Mr. principal. Of course, I just told an absolute nonsense, but I don’t remember\nneither my father nor my mother, and as long as I remember my life – my brother was raising, educating\nand teaching me. I got used to seeing my father in him. That’s why I told you this so badly.”\n\n“It is very good that you love your brother so much, but who was preparing you for your\nexaminations? Your knowledge is so profound.”\n\n“My brother helped me to learn according to the program of the secondary school, I didn’t\nhave any other teachers.”\n\n```\n“And who is your brother?” the teacher asked me, smiling.\n```\n```\n“He’s the officer of N. regiment,” I answered them.\n```\nThey only exchanged glances, and the principal still with his amazed eyes, but smiling with\nhis kind, oldish smile told me.\n\n```\n“Either you possess some phenomenal talents or your brother is an exceptional educator.”\n```\n“Or yes, my brother is not only an educator, but he’s such a scientist that there’s no other\nsuch like him,” I snapped out with enthusiasm. “Here he is!” I gave a shout after seeing the kind face of my\nbrother through the window of the class door.\n\nHaving forgotten where I was, who was standing in front of me and why I was here, I darted\nout into the corridor and wound my hands round my brother’s neck. As now I remember that hot feeling\nwhich I experienced back then – the feeling of love, gratitude, grief before our future separation, joy of\nsuch usual caress...\n\nHaving undone my hands in silence, my brother stepped into the class, drew himself up in\nfront of the principal and told him.\n\n“Your excellency, forgive my brother. During my nomadic life I succeeded to give him that\nlittle knowledge that I possessed, but I failed to teach him good manners and discipline. I hope that your\nlucid management will correct this mistake of mine.”\n\nThe principal stretched out his hand to him, introduced him to the teacher who was\nexamining him curiously and said a lot of compliments about the level of my knowledge and my excellent\nabilities, but the first splinter showed up in my heart. I understood that I brought a disgrace upon my\nbrother. I remember how he always used to repeat to me that I had to be reserved and tactful, to go deep\ninto every situation, always to perceive where I was and who was in front of me, and only then to act.\n\nAll of it, this episode from my childhood rose in my memory, summoned by the same spasm\nof my heart like back then. I met a stranger for the first time, who became dear and close to me like a real\nbrother, - and once again I was feeling like an unexperienced child who didn’t know how to approach a\n\n\nstranger, who didn’t know what to say to him and how to behave, so that I would fulfil Florentian’s wish\nand make him happy with my behaviour... I was standing in the corridor, not bringing myself to knock upon\nthe door of the adjacent compartment, and as if lit up the lightning this first childish lesson of tact flashed\nin my head.\n\nHaving pressed my lips together, I remembered the lines from Ali’s letter: “I will overcome”\nand I gave a knock upon the door.\n\n```\n“Come in,” an unfamiliar strange voice uttered.\n```\nI opened the door and I almost ran back to Florentian, as back then when I ran from the class\nto my brother.\n\nTwo tall men were sitting on the sofas one opposite to another, but I could see only two\npairs of the eyes: the eyes of the dervish, which had stuck in my memory from our first meeting – the eyes-\nstars, and the attentive, nearly black eyes of the Greek, which remembered me of the piercing look of old\nAli.\n\n“Let me become acquainted with you according to all rules of politeness,” Sandra Kon-\nAnanda told me, while he was standing up. “Here’s my friend Ilofilion.”\n\nAnanda squeezed my hand, and I bowed to the Greek, modestly rumpling my cap in my\nhand. I snapped out like a bad schoolboy would do with his by heart learnt lesson.\n\n“My friend Florentian sent me to you. Would you like to drink a cup of coffee with me in the\ndining-car? I can accompany you there.”\n\nSuddenly the Greek’s eyes stopped pricking me with his awls, a humour lit up in them. He\nrose quickly, squeezed my hand and spoke up in Russian with a strong accent. He must have been choosing\nhis words, but he was speaking absolutely correctly.\n\n“I think that in this place birds of a feather flock together. You are also timid like I am. Well,\nthen let’s come together. Of course, we don’t find two and we’ll lose four, but anyway both of us are fitted\none for another, and probably, until we decide to order our breakfast, - everything will be eaten from\nunder our very nose, and we’ll stay hungry.”\n\nHe made such sad face and then laughed so merrily that I forgot all my shyness and, not\nholding anymore, I started rocking with laughter, asserting him that I’ll be even impudent if needed, but I\nwill feed him to satiety.\n\n```\nWe left the compartment, accompanied with a merry laughter of Kon-Ananda.\n```\nWhen we entered the dining-car, I quickly found a small table in the nonsmokers’ area,\nordered the breakfast and tried to occupy my new acquaintance by addressing him in German. He\nanswered me willingly and asked me if I had been in Greece. I answered him regretfully that I hadn’t been\nanywhere else except Moscow, Petersburg, Northern Caucasus and K. where I had been for the first time\nand for a very short time.\n\nOur coffee was brought, and I, by taking advantage of the right to eat in silence, was\nobserving the Greek secretly, but intently.\n\nApparently, at the moment destiny was rewarding me so plentifully for my monotonous\nchildhood and youth by sending me so many events and people – they were not only exceptional, but they\ndidn’t even fit in my consciousness. It seemed to me that it would suffice to put on the head of this Greek a\n\n\nwreath of roses, to throw a Greek chiton on his shoulders, and here’s a model standing in front of you: one\ncould shape a god of Olympus, a king of ancient times, a prophet from him, but being in modern clothes he\nsurpassed the boundaries of my consciousness. His European suit didn’t fit him, German language didn’t\nsound in his lips – some Italian or Spanish dialect would have suited him best. The harmony of regular\nfeatures of his face wasn’t worsen neither by his rather low forehead with the thrusted up elevations above\nhis eye-brows which were thin, curved and long – until his very temples, nor by the tenderness of his skin\nnear his black blue hair, nor his hardly revealed moustache... One could really say about him: “Beautiful like\na God.”\n\nHowever, he didn’t have that charm with which Florentian was attracting me so much. If I\nwasn’t feeling any formal obstacles between myself and Florentian, although I understood the difference\nthat existed between us and his enormous superiority when compared to myself, then Ilofilion seemed to\nme to be retired into the circle of his own thoughts. As though he had fenced himself off me, and it seemed\nthat no one could manage to penetrate into these thoughts unless he wanted it himself.\n\nHaving waited for the next stop, by walking along the platform, we went to our carriage. The\nGreek thanked me for my attention shown and added that I was a very pleasant guide, because I could be\nsilent and I wasn’t curious.\n\nI answered him that I spent my childhood close to my brother who was very serious and\nrather silent, and that my youth didn’t spoil me with such meetings where anyone could be interested in\nme, so on the contrary as it seemed to him, by being very curious I learned to think to myself in silence as\nhe did.\n\n```\nHe gave a smile and noticed that mathematicians – if they are really devoted to their science\n```\n- are mostly demure persons and they can go so deeply into the logical course of things in their thoughts\nthat they perceive even the universe as a stretched out geometrical plan, so they are frightened and feel\nshy when they are facing a vanity, a tasteless and unconsidered expression of thoughts or a noisy jabber\ninstead of a really deep thought out conversation which should prevail among people. Then they are\nescaping the crowd and the racket of the cities, which is alien to the logic of nature’s life.\n\nHe also asked me if I liked a country-side and how I was imagining my future life. I answered\nhim that until now my entire life flew past by sitting on the secondary school and student benches. I told\nhim laughing how I performed during my entrance examinations. I also told him about my first sadness –\nthe separation with my brother and my life in Petersburg, and then I said to him as though drawing a\nconclusion to myself of a certain period of my life.\n\n“Now I’m in my second year of the university, and the trouble is the same – I’m a\nmathematician, but the studies haven’t yet revealed any understanding what I would like to choose in my\nlife, where I would like to live, and I still don’t grasp at all what place I’m taking in the universe.”\n\nWe were standing in the corridor, and my companion proposed me to drop in at his\ncompartment. I didn’t even notice how our conversation acquired a warm and friendly nature. I wasn’t\nfeeling shy anymore of the strictness of my new acquaintance, on the contrary, I was feeling as though a\nrest and relief from him. My thoughts were flowing calmly, I wanted to find out more about the universities\nof Berlin and London – it was simply great to sit with my new friend.\n\nAnd at the same time I wanted to cast a glance at Florentian and to tell him that I didn’t\ndisgrace him by fulfilling his assignment, that the Greek was really an interesting person.\n\n\nI already wanted to tell him that I would drop in at my compartment for a minute when the\ndoor opened and Kon-Ananda entered. He explained to us that Florentian fell asleep and if it was\ninteresting for me to talk to Ilofilion, then he would be glad to protect the sleep of my dear friend.\n\nI already knew well what kind of sleep that was and agreed with pleasure to exchange the\nplaces with Ananda for some time.\n\nI and Ilofilion continued our interrupted conversation. The more he was talking the more I\nwas surprised by his knowledge, observation, and most importantly – by the power of his general\nconclusions.\n\nI also was thinking that I had some synthetic talents, I knew logic perfectly and was reading\nquite a lot. And now, compared to my companion’s expression of thought and language, all my so called\namazing talents seemed to be a pitiful rubbish, dumped in the common pile of a flea market.\n\n“I’m feeling so strange today, as if I had entered a new university and heard a row of the\nmost interesting lectures.” And I asked him “Perhaps, you could tell me more about the students’ lives, the\nlevel of their education and about their interests.”\n\nAnd again our conversation was flowing, besides my companion drew me a parallel between\nthe students from Greece, Germany, Paris and London, because he had an opportunity to observe all of\nthem in his own time.\n\nI was devouring every word. He was speaking so simply and at the same time so\npicturesquely that it seemed to me as though I was travelling with him myself and watching everything with\nmy own eyes.\n\nA passionate desire for knowledge, a wish to see the world, the people, to get to know their\ncustoms aroused an ecstasy in me. I lost the perception of time and space, I forgot that I acquired my whole\neducation only thanks to my brother, a poor Russian officer, and I decided that I would certainly see the\nentire world, I wouldn’t leave a single little corner unvisited.\n\n```\n“Would you like to travel?” I heard I.’s question.\n```\nAs if I had fallen from the moon, only now I could understand that I wouldn’t be able to\ntravel the world, but I even didn’t have enough means to travel my native Russia, because I was a poor\nperson and up to now I could earn only pennies thanks to my lessons and translations.\n\n“I would like to travel very much,” I sighed, “but I don’t have much luck with travelling.\nHaving graduated the secondary school and entered the university, only now after five years of separation\nwith my brother, I got ready for a journey to Asia to visit him. I was dreaming about seeing that new world\nto me, another nation – and here’s how it all ended. And I even lost my brother,” I added, silently\nremembering with what joy I was going to the distant K. to see him and with what pain I was coming back\nfrom there.\n\n```\nI. bent down by me, looked into my eyes extremely tenderly and told me silently.\n```\n“I sympathize with you from the bottom of my heart, dear friend. I’ve also gone through the\nsame moment of my life when in one day I lost everything and everyone whom I loved, but my state was\nmuch worse than yours, because I was unable to help anyone from my family. I was severely wounded and\nwhen I regained my consciousness I could see only cold corpses of my family members, and everything\nwhat was connected to my hopes, ideals, aspirations, searching of truth and honour – all of that was also\n\n\nrooted out of my heart and turned into ashes, because the murderers seemed to be hypocrite fanatics who\nwere pretending to be friends...”\n\n```\nHi was silent for a while and then he continued with even more sincere voice.\n```\n“Your situation is much better than that segment of my life. You haven’t lost your brother\nyet, you’re only separated from him. You can still help him and you’re already started doing so. When I\ndropped in at Ali’s on a short visit five years ago, I became acquainted with your brother. Ali told me about\nthe pure life of the great self-educated scientist, about his selfless devotion for the freedom of his nation. I\nremember how I was moved by such uncharacteristic features of the Russian officer. Already during our\nfirst meeting I could perceive so much in his wonderful face and at once I became his loyal friend. Even\nfrom the observations of your short life you know that the characters who are consistent and balanced are\nunable to give others only a part of their heart or friendship. We used to see each other with your brother\nback then. That was me who used to supplement his excellent library by sending him a rarer book. It is\namazing how a nomad officer’s life didn’t prevent him from carrying with himself the chests loaded with\nbooks everywhere he was going. When he settled in K., then he really collected a real value – the library of\na wise man. It is so sad that everything was lost...”\n\n```\nHe was silent for a while again, then he moved a little nearer to me and added.\n```\n“I know your state from my own experience. What I’m going to tell you now, I decided to say\nto you only because I’ve passed myself all stages of human sadness which you’re experiencing right now.\nOne shouldn’t think, as the youth loves to, that the whole life’s value is its offered personal happiness.\nDon’t think that the essence of your current state is the suffering and the dangers which you’re\nexperiencing because of your brother. Reject your personal feelings and thoughts about yourself. Think\nonly about the safety of your brother, about that your action and energy which you have to dedicate to him\nnow and in the future, so that he would come out of all dangers alive and free. Fanatics and the czar’s\ngovernment are scheming dozens of traps for him. They don’t love very much the intellectual officers. If\nyou didn’t meet your brother...”\n\n```\n“What,” I gave a shout out of horror, “you think that he’s dead?”\n```\n“Oh no, I’m sure that he’s alive and he’s in Petersburg already,” I. answered to me. “I’m\ntalking only about one of the possible chances that now you won’t be able to see your brother and that\nhe’ll be unable to take you with him.”\n\n“Oh, how terrible that would be! We haven’t spent even two months together during all\nthose five years, only those rare meetings when he used to visit me in Petersburg for short periods of time.\nI was hoping so much. Finally my dream came true and I had to spend all summer with him, even a part of\nautumn – and I’m alone again...”\n\nOnce again I was devoured by sadness, irritation, protest. It seemed to me that some people\nhave interfered between me and my brother, attracting him to the interests of a foreign nation, while I, his\nbrother-son, was abandoned, forgotten and unwanted. The whirls of passions, a storm was breaking my\nheart! Jealousy like a wild horse was dragging my thoughts from one event to another, from one kind of\npeople to another one...\n\nMy friend was silent. I was silent for a long time, too. Finally my irritation started settling\ndown. I stopped wringing my hands, and my loyalty to my brother, my gratitude for all his love and worries\novercame the difficult thoughts of my egoism and despair.\n\n\nI remembered my brother’s face on the road, below the big tree, when Ali landed Nal from\nthe coach. I was surprised by that face of a stranger back then – of the man of an exceptional will, even his\neye-brows had stretched themselves into one line. That wasn’t my kind brother whom I knew, that was a\nstranger whose flow of energy was sweeping everything on its way like a lava. I was only surprised back\nthen and I didn’t draw any conclusion which, of course, a more experienced person would have drawn, or\nperhaps, the uncommonness and speed of the following events buried that conclusion in my consciousness\nand only now it came to light for me: I understood that I didn’t know my brother at all, that everything\nwhat he gave to me, the total orphan, was only a little part of his consciousness, that he was trying to make\nup for the misery of my childhood spent without love of my mother...\n\nAnd suddenly I burst into tears like a small child. I was feeling deceived by the wonderful\nillusion which I had created myself and because of that I became even more lonesome. My brother-father\nwas that person who belonged only to me, whose only worry was me, whose only meaning of life was also\nme.\n\nUp until this moment I was imagining that he also, like myself, used to start and finish his day\nwith thoughts about me and that he was living only thinking of a possibility to meet me some day and\nnever separate again in his life.\n\nNow, while fighting against my own illusion, I could also see another person in my brother, a\nstranger, I could perceive a row of his interests which weren’t related to me, his solidarity with other\npeople whom I hardly knew.\n\nFor the first time the following question rose in my consciousness: “Who is a brother at all?\nWho is the real brother? What role the blood kinship is playing in people’s lives? What is bringing people\ntogether more: harmony of their thoughts, feelings, interests or the fact that they were given birth by the\nsame mother?”\n\nI couldn’t feel the river of my tears, but now it already wasn’t a passionate lament of my\njealous despair, now everything rose in absolutely another importance: as if I had buried my childhood and\nits beauty; as if I had rooted my old habits out of myself to perceive people only like a support to myself. As\nif I was entering the new life of a mature man, which was still unknown to me, in which the words\n“mother”, “father” and tenderness connected to them were drawing to the second plan; or maybe it simply\nwas only a sweet dream about the family which I didn’t have a chance to know during all my life, the family\nin which I could become a support myself.\n\nNow it is difficult to put into words all those experiences of the youth, but apparently the\nperception of how young, how childish and unexperienced in the matters of life, how uneducated I still\nwas, also added a drop of bitterness.\n\nI was trying to suppress my tears with all my strength. I was feeling ashamed of weeping so\nrelentlessly next to a stranger. Only when my thought from remorse turned to my brother, I remembered\nAli’s letter once again and Florentian’s words uttered to me not long ago. I mopped away my tears and, not\nlifting my eyes to my companion, I told him silently.\n\n```\n“Excuse me, I lost my self-control.”\n```\nI was waiting for a usual, perhaps even friendly sympathy, but what I heard showed me once\nagain that I absolutely didn’t know people.\n\n“I was crying as bitterly as you are now many times. Believe me, it isn’t easy for anybody to\npart from his childhood. The illusion of beauty and love created by our own imagination is torturing us for\n\n\nas long as we gain a victory over it. Only then our illusory desires to live in the dream of imaginary beauty\nclear away when the real beauty which is hiding within ourselves comes to life. All blows of grief, losses and\ndisappointment are teaching us to understand that there’s no happiness in the conditional illusions.\nHappiness exists only in a free and voluntary work which doesn’t depend on any praise or reward that are\nbeing poured upon us for doing it – in that work which we are carrying into our daily routine as an activity\nof love and joy by dedicating it to people’s welfare and happiness.”\n\n```\nI. embraced me and started telling me the story of his life.\n```\nHaving come to himself after a long fainting-fit, he saw that he was lying in the pool of blood\namong his friends and family members. Everyone who’s been with him since the very start of his childhood\nwas dead. He didn’t know neither where to go nor what to do – all his family was killed. He remembered\nthat an old nurse was living in the mountains not far away from this valley where the house of his parents\nwas standing. Of course, he didn’t know which political party she was in sympathy with, and the yesterday’s\nlike-minded people – today’s enemies could have killed her, too, as well as several families from this valley.\n\nThere was not time for thinking. I. descended by the sea, took a swim, put someone’s clothes\non, which were dropped or lost on shore and moved along a solitary path towards another side of the\nisland to his nurse, while shedding his tears.\n\n“I won’t trouble you with the details of that wandering,” I. continued. “I will only mention\nbriefly that with the help of the little old woman and her money I boarded the ship which was going to\nRome where her son was living, a gifted jeweller, as she told me herself. I must have died on the ship out of\ngrief and hunger if Kon-Ananda whom you know already hadn’t found me. Having lost all my strengths due\nto fever, losing my consciousness again and again, I heard an Italian talk over me, which I knew from my\nItalian nurse. A young, clear and charming voice was speaking.\n\n```\n“Whe is he, Nika? A boy is lying here.”\n```\nAnother hoarse and rough voice, as though with reluctance, was straining his words through\nhis teeth.\n\n```\n“It’s not a boy. It’s an ordinary boozy drunkard.”\n```\nI didn’t have any strength, although I wanted to give a cry from the bottom of my heart that I\nwasn’t drunk, that I was dying out of hunger and cold, and that I was asking for help. I had already been\nready to die, and this hope of salvation which flashed and disappeared seemed to me like only one more\njeering of destiny. The heavy steps moved away by taking the grumble of the hoarse voice with them. I\nthought that another voice would vanish in the distance, too, when suddenly a strong and tender hand\nlifted my head a little, and a grievous “oh”, like a sigh, escaped someone’s lips.\n\nMy weakness didn’t allow me to open my eyes. The stranger who had bent over me gave a\nscream to his attendant. The attendant again came to me unwillingly, he could hardly walk. An insistent\ntone of the young voice, in which an unshakable will could be heard changed the mood of the grumbler in a\nflash.\n\n“Bring the stretcher right now and call the doctor, old sluggard! So this is how you were\nprotecting our belongings in the hold that you didn’t even see how a man was dying here.”\n\n“It is my fault, master. This pilferer must have showed here only now. I’ve been checking the\nboxes all the time, all of them were in order.”\n\n\n“Stop pattering nonsense. What pilferer is he? He’s a sickly boy! Get the stretcher and the\ndoctor as soon as possible! Do you want to feel my stick again?”\n\nWhere his tired legs were gone? “Understood”, the servant uttered only this with his\nsonorous voice and ran like I had never run even when I was healthy.\n\n“Poor boy”, I heard the same sincere voice; and how tender that voice was, it reached my\nheart like a mother’s caress, while his tears burning like a fire were pouring on my cheeks.\n\n```\n“Do you hear me, poor boy?”\n```\nI wanted to answer him, but only a moan escaped my parched lips: I was unable to move my\ntongue, it was as though lifeless, rough, as a foreign body that didn’t want to obey my will.\n\n```\n“I will save you, I will save you at any price”, the stranger continued. “My uncle is a doctor...”\n```\n```\nBut I didn’t hear anything else, I fell down into an abyss...\n```\nI came to myself in a spacious and bright room. The windows were opened. There was a soft\nbed and clean bedding, so I thought for a while that I was at home. My memory had carried away my entire\nexperienced terror, and I was waiting for my mother to come and scold me for my laziness. Being a Greek,\nshe was in the habit of talking to me in German, because her nurse was talking like this.\n\nI was still waiting for her sweet “Lolion”, but for some reason she was lingering. Then I\ndecided to scare her slightly, as I used to do it in my early childhood by shouting at the top of my voice, and\nshe would pretend to be very frightened, she would put her hands pleadingly and speak to me in German\njokingly.\n\n“Oh, mister hunter, the crocodile will indeed devour me. Please don’t waste your time for\nyour scream, kill it as soon as possible.”\n\nI gave a shout with all my might, as it seemed to me, but only a small voice came out, which\nwas similar to a prolonged moan.\n\n“Well, he’s come to himself,” I could hear a voice over me. “Uncle, you are not a doctor, but\na wonder-worker.”\n\nWith these words, two men who were absolutely unknown to me came to my bed. Once of\nthem, as you’ve already understood was Kon-Ananda, whom I don’t need to describe to you, while the\nother man was still not old, but he was much older than him. His kind-hearted face, his kind brownish eyes\nand some nondescript nobility, his manners which I hadn’t seen before revealed to me instantly that he\nwas a man of aristocracy. One can read about such men only in novels, but usually a man of middle-class\ncannot reach them. I understood that I was seeing a nobleman for the first time.\n\n“So, my friend, now we can be sure that you’ll recover completely,” the nobleman told me in\nItalian. “Could you tell me, what day is today?”\n\nI was looking at him, not understanding anything. My memory hadn’t yet come back to me.\nHe poured some liquid into the glass, which was smelling sweet and strong, and he helped me to drink it. I\nlooked at Ananda’s face, but of course, I didn’t recognize my rescuer. I was drowsy again.\n\nWhen I woke up again, it seemed to me that a woman was sitting by my bed. I thought that\nshe was my mother. This time I remembered everything about my previous waking up and I wasn’t\nsurprised at all when I saw Ananda, I only began to speak in German unintentionally.\n\n\n```\n“I saw my mother next to me. Why did she leave?”\n```\n“She got tired very much,” his answer followed. “If you agree, I will give you something to\neat. Although what you will get cannot be called a dinner, but the doctor is very strict and he allowed only\nthin gruel and pap to eat for you.”\n\nHe helped me to sit up in my bed, and I almost fainted away, although he was trying to help\nme as carefully as possible. He quickly gave me a gulp of wine. He had to feed me with the spoon...\n\nSuch life continued for about a month. When I used to ask him about my mother, she either\nwas sleeping or tired, or she was gone for shopping. To my question whose room was here, he always used\nto answer: “Yours”. Once I asked him why my nurse wasn’t coming to visit me. He answered that if I\nremembered her address, then I could write her a letter, so she could come.\n\n“How could I not remember her address?” I was indignant. “This is the same as though I\nwouldn’t know my mother’s address.”\n\nI dictated him my nurse’s address instantly and asked her to come tomorrow. He gave a\nlaugh, saying that if he succeeds to get a flying carpet, then he would fly himself to visit her. I couldn’t\nunderstand anything again.\n\nOne more week passed. The nobleman doctor visited me several times and he allowed me to\nget up. That was the real comedy when I was trying to stand up for the first time with the help of Ananda. I\nwas fifteen years old and tall, and now I grew up so much during my illness that even the doctor was\nsurprised.\n\n“My friend, well, how is it possible to grow so much?” he was laughing. “If you keep doing so,\nthen nobody, even your nurse won’t recognize you.”\n\nThis time I somehow managed to perceive that there was quite a lot of time gone, but still\nthere was no nurse, my mother was still hiding. I looked at the doctor, but he, as though not seeing my\npleading look, helped me to put the dressing-gown on, and both of them with Ananda brought me to the\nwindow. The high arm-chair with the foot was standing here in such a way that I could admire the view\nbehind the window while I was sitting in it.\n\nNot taking my eyes off, I was looking at the sea that extended in the distance and at the\ngarden that was going down its coast. Not recognizing the landscape and not being able to perceive\nanything, I asked the doctor why I was living here. Our home was in the valley, while I had never been here,\nhigh in the mountains and I didn’t know these places.\n\nThe doctor’s face was very serious, although it was absolutely calm, too. He took my hand\nand he was holding it in such a way as though he would have counted my pulse, but I was certain that he\nwasn’t counting it, he wanted to transfer a part of his energy and cheerfulness to me.\n\n“If you want to see your nurse,” he told me silently while stroking my hair with his free hand,\n“I can ask her to come. I only want to tell you, my boy, that you are almost a man already, while your nurse\nis weak and old. It seems that she will have to tell you about something unpleasant. Try to remain calm,\nthink how to make this difficult moment easier for her. Forget about your pain if it stuns you, try to control\nyour tears with all your strength, so that the old woman would see that she has raised the real man and not\nthe milksop with the trousers.”\n\nHe turned towards the door, commanded somebody to bring the nurse and kept stroking my\nhair while speaking to me calmly.\n\n\n“Everything in life is changing, my boy. There may be not a single moment of respite in a\nman’s life. All sorts of affairs and meetings are forcing the man to move, in this way he’s growing and\nchanging continuously. Everything what consciousness is presenting like a logical thought, everything is\nchanging and broadening together with the coming wisdom. If the man fails to accept the changing\ncircumstances wisely, fails to become the power that controls them – then they destroy him, like cold\ndestroys the mushroom’s life, like drought destroys the mould’s life. And of course, the man who fails – by\nchanging himself – to carry the life of new circumstances on his shoulders easily and simply, will become\nonly like that mushroom or mould, and not the radiance of his thought which is growing in creativity and\nhardening itself in fight.”\n\nNot taking my eyes off him, I was listening to him greedily and drawing his every word to\nmyself. His kindness which was spurting out of his face and his hand which was stroking my hair tenderly\nwere as though giving me love and fortitude. All of a sudden I understood that there was a friend next to\nme, such a grand friend that his hand was the support for me not only during this moment; it was so strong\nthat even my entire life would fail to cause trouble to that flow of love which was burning within that man.\n\nI was flooded with some respectful and refreshing joy, gratitude, the feeling of courage and\nself-confidence which I hadn’t yet experienced before. I pressed the hand that was stroking me tenderly to\nmy lips, kissed it and answered him.\n\n“I will always try to be strong. Oh, how I would like to be like you – so kind, intelligent and\nstrong. I’m feeling exceptionally well being next to you. As though I’ve grown up and changed.”\n\n```\nHe embraced me, pressed to his heart, kissed my forehead and told me.\n```\n“Be strong now. Exactly how you’ll overcome this meeting with your nurse, so you’ll start\nyour new life.”\n\n```\nAfter saying this he left me, and in a moment my nurse came into the room.\n```\nShe was an old woman already, but whom I was seeing now were total ruins. She also was\nsurprised by the change that had happened within me.\n\nNot even having time to come to me, she only clapped her hands, gave a groan, began to cry,\nknelt on the foot of my arm-chair, grabbed my hands and started weeping so much that the fortitude in my\nheart was melting like a wax.\n\nAlthough I had grown up in the country where people often used to reveal their feelings with\ncries and gestures, although from my childhood I could remember perfectly the pure Italian exaltation that\nwas characteristic to my nurse, which would catch fire suddenly like a match and then it would go out\nsuddenly, too, but this time I could hear in her lament so much heartbreak and despair that I couldn’t find\nany words of comfort for her. Like a refrain between her tears now and again the following words stood\nout: “My poor boy! My dear orphan, you don’t have even your own motherland.”\n\nSome obscure memories started oppressing me. My thoughts were spinning sluggishly and\nwith difficulty like a cumbersome millstone. Up to now I can remember that unusually strange feeling in my\nhead, which I never experienced again. It seemed to me that I could simply feel some purely physical\nmovement that was taking place in my cerebral hemispheres, which I could perceive like my thoughts\nmoving with difficulty. Apparently, all blood from my heart flowed into my head; I felt a stinging pain in my\nheart like a prick of a long needle, and all of a sudden, like in the fire of a flash, I could remember\neverything at once.\n\n\nI don’t know if I fainted in that moment, but I could understand clearly that in my memory all\nmy experiences floated past one after another...\n\nWhen I could already align my thoughts again, I could see Ananda standing next to me, and\nonly now I could understand that it was him who was whispering in the hold of the steamer: “I will save\nyou, boy.”\n\nAnanda was looking at me focussed and he gave me some kind of a drink. Having drunk it, I\ntold him.\n\n“Thank you. Thank you for saving my life. No, I don’t need it,” I pushed away his hand with\nanother medicine. “No medicine can cure me now, but only that example of your and your uncle’s love and\ncare of the stranger who was hurled away by fate, which I found here. I don’t understand how I could\nforget everything. I remembered only when my nurse’s voice and her tears took me back to my childhood,\nwhen I heard that I didn’t have even my motherland – then I could remember everything at once.”\n\nI still was unable to summon up my strength for a long time; my breathing was so heavy, as\nthough a short breath of asthma had pressed my lungs. Ananda persuaded me to drink some drops, he put\na pinch of yellow and dry grass into the plate and set it on fire. Soon a strong aroma pervaded and I was\nfeeling better.\n\n```\n“Where am I now? Is that your house?” I asked Ananda.\n```\n“This is Sicily,” he answered to me. “You’re safe here. This is the doctor’s house. The\nslaughter of the revolted parties in your motherland continues and the misfortunes are falling down on\ninnocent people. The fanatic politicians are killing not only one another, but even the foreigners, and this\npromises the war for your entire country. You can find out about the details from the newspapers which\nI’ve saved for you. You’ve been ill for more than two months. Every day during the first month my uncle\nwas afraid that he would be unable to snatch you from the clutches of death. Only during the second\nmonth of your illness he announced that the danger was over, and two weeks ago he fixed the exact day\nwhen you recover your consciousness. The loss of your memory could affect the entire course of your\nthoughts. In doctor’s opinion, the meeting with your nurse had to be the turning point, what has happened\nexactly.”\n\nThen he told me how they took me to the cabin of the steamer, how both of them, he and\nhis uncle in turns kept watching me by my bedside, how many times in my ravings I was telling all my story\nup to the moment of my boarding of the ship. Now he asked me how I had gotten to the hold of the\nsteamer, but I didn’t remember, or perhaps I simply didn’t know what that hold was. I only remembered\nthat I was looking for a peaceful place where I could hide from people and cry my disaster out.\n\n“Then my story is absolutely simple,” I. continued. “I won’t be telling you of how many times\nthe storms of despair, resentment and hopeless heartbreak were changing within me, how many times I\nwas breaking the hearts of my benefactors and nurse with my relentless lament. I only will stress that not a\nsingle of such attacks of my irritation gave rise to any resentment or reproach of my new friends. Gradually,\nthe atmosphere of constant tenderness and respectable culture prompted me to step into the self-control.\nI could see and understand clearly how uneducated I was, how indelicate my behaviour was, because I was\ndisturbing the quiet rhythm of lives of my rescuers, which were always filled with the scientific work of the\ndoctor and Ananda’s activity by his thesis.\n\nI could already walk in the garden, I even used to go down by the sea, but the doctor didn’t\nallow me to read yet, saying that if I can spend at least one week without any tears, then he would give me\n\n\na book. My wish to start learning and to read was so big that I showed my character and I didn’t\ndemonstrate my pain publicly, but only entrusted it to my pillow at night.\n\nOn one of the red-letter days the doctor commanded to harness the horses, and we left for a\nride, so I could admire Sicily. The nature here was like a real fairy-tale.\n\nWhile we were riding, the doctor asked me if I knew well the history of my country. To my\nshame, I had to admit that I didn’t know it at all. When we came back, the doctor took me to his study.\nThere were so many books here that I even sat down out of amazement. Not only the walls were built all\naround with them, but the shelves of the books were formed along the entire room from the ceiling down\nto the floor, leaving only the narrow corridors where in each of them a light collapsible ladder was standing.\nIn one of these corridors the doctor took the history of Ancient Greece from the shelf. It was written in\nGerman.\n\nMy studies started from that day on. Each of my new friends used to find a possibility to\nbreak away from his occupation, so they could help me. I was trying with all my might, and my old nurse\nhad to complain of her solitude; only that would make me break away from the books and lessons and go\nto the sea with her.\n\nMy talents for mathematics were revealed, and jokingly I was nicknamed Euclid. Both of my\nguardians were calling me like that, only my nurse kept calling me Lolion.\n\nI was totally cured during my six months of work and peaceful life. I grew up even more, but I\nremained as thin as I was before and the heartbreak kept eating my heart out.\n\nDuring one of our dinners the doctor told us that he was preparing himself to go to Rome in\none week where he would spend a month, then he would go to Berlin with his affairs.\n\n```\n“Would you like to come with me as my secretary?” he addressed me with the question.\n```\n```\nBeing in doubt, I took a look at Ananda, he gave me a tender smile, but kept silent.\n```\n“What is stopping you?” the doctor asked me again. “Don’t you really want to look around\nthe world about which you are reading so intensely at the moment?”\n\n“I want to see it all very much, especially Rome. Besides, I would be happy if I could show\ngratitude to you for everything that you’ve done for me, but I’m afraid that I wouldn’t be able to be such\nsecretary whom you need. Anyway I will try to be your diligent and honest servant. I’m also worried how\nmy nurse is going to sustain this separation, because she doesn’t have anybody except me, right?”\n\n“She has a son in Rome. We will take her there. You will already orient yourself in the\nitineraries of the trains on your way back, so you can come to Rome and take her here again. Make up your\nmind. One day you will have to step into life anyway and to acquire a corresponding education. You will be\nable to choose the university that you like during this journey, and you don’t even have to worry about\nyour future now.”\n\nWishing to end the story of my life in a few words – only happy words from now on – I will\nadd that in a few days the doctor, me and my nurse left to Rome. We left the old woman in Rome. You can\nimagine yourself what I experienced by getting to know this city, its monuments, galleries, museums...\nWhile I was running about in the city and fulfilling the doctor’s assignments, I was thanking my nurse in\nevery of my steps, because she had taught me Italian language.\n\nNot two months, but half year flew past while we were travelling from one place to another.\nI took care of the program of Berlin’s secondary schools and received it, so I could continue my regular\n\n\nstudies. Every day I was getting up at six o’clock in the morning and I was preparing myself for my\nexaminations for all seven classes at once.\n\nOnce I revealed this idea to the doctor. He verified my knowledge and he was happy with it.\nHe recommended me to come back home, to work with Ananda for a while and to take a school-leaving\ncertificate examinations at once in Heidelberg where Ananda would maintain his thesis and he would be\nliving there for at least a year.\n\nI accepted this proposal with pleasure. We went together to Vienna and then we parted\nthere. I came back to Rome alone via Venice, while the doctor decided to spend a year or two in his estate\nin Hungary, having explained to me that I, Ananda and my nurse would spend the summer at his place.\n\nMy life has been passing like this from that time on. I was learning a lot and had time to see\nlots of the world: I was travelling in Egypt, India, I saw all kinds of wise men and scientists, artists and\npainters, but I didn’t have a chance to meet a more superior man that the doctor. Accidentally, one of his\nassignments brought me together with Ali and Florentian, in whom I noticed the knowledge, power,\nkindness and honour that was equal to my great friend’s. The strong friendship that was uniting them\namong themselves opened up for me and Ananda, too.\n\nNow in my story I’m proceeding to that period of my friendship with Ali when I came to K. to\nstay at his place for a while and when I became acquainted with your brother. Of course, you know your\nbrother better than I do. I can only add that his power of spirit, his will, his love to man, his great mind and\nknowledge raise this self-taught officer higher than all wise men and scientists whom I’ve met, and he’s\nalmost equal to those great friends of mine about whom I’ve just been talking to you.\n\nDon’t feel shy of me. I’ve endured all my sufferings myself, I understood the abyss of\nmankind’s grief, and the heart which has blown in its disaster once cannot condemn another man or feel\nburdened by his tears and troubles. I’ve learnt to see my brother in another man.\n\nOur conversation has been continuing for a long time more. We missed our breakfast, and\nnow we were already invited for dinner...\n\nI forgot to think about myself, about my life. I.’s picturesque story when it seemed that he\nwas striking every episode like a sculptor with his chisel – so precise and clear were his words and thoughts\n\n- drew me into the vortex of another boy’s life, who was much more unfortunate that I was.\n\nI. offered me to wash myself and to have our dinner. I didn’t object, understanding that now\nit would be easiest for both of us to sit down at the dinner’s table in silence for a while. When we came\nback to the carriage, we found Ananda and Florentian in the corridor, who were having a chat with some\ntravellers.\n\nI was so glad seeing Florentian, as though I hadn’t seen him for the whole year. I understood\nonce again how I got attached to him with the entire heat of my childish heart during this short period of\ntime. He extended both of his hands to me with joy, which I squeezed immediately.\n\n```\n“How I missed you,” I uttered him merrily.\n```\n“And I thought I would ingratiate myself with you, because I hasn’t yet learned to sleep\naccording to your taste,” he answered me merrily, too. “Only you aren’t very polite with respect to I. I\nhope, Euclid, that you haven’t tired my little brother with mathematics?”\n\n“No, no, your friend I. helped me so much with his conversation that I’ve become ten years\nwiser instantly.”\n\n\nEverybody gave a laugh. Florentian embraced me by my shoulders, put the comic expression\nof the lord Benedict and asked me.\n\n```\n“Is it possible that in my company you kept standing in one place or even grew stupid?”\n```\nOnce again I felt how one should follow every of one’s words. I gave a sigh and, not knowing\nwhat to answer him, I turned my eyes towards I. He stated immediately that everybody knew well his\nunique florentian talent to cavil at every word, and that not without reason he, Euclid, was a better\nmathematician than he was and that one time he would somehow catch Florentian himself, maybe even in\na subtler way.\n\nI proposed to organize a dinner for Florentian in the compartment. Hungry Ananda\nresponded to that especially joyfully. I hurried away to demonstrate my administrative skill.\n\nSoon the best vegetarian dishes which could be made in the train were served. Although me\nand I. had already had our dinner, but we didn’t refuse to dine now.\n\nWe had to go one more night to Moscow, and in the morning I could already hope to see my\nbrother. My thoughts migrated to the joy of upcoming meeting so quickly, I was imagining so vividly with\nwhat new perception I would be looking at my brother now that I broke away from my surroundings\ncompletely, I wasn’t seeing or hearing anything what was going on around me.\n\nAll of a sudden some kind of moisture on my hands which I had put on the little table made\nme to give a start. That was Florentian who moistened the corner of the napkin in the water and put it on\nmy hands. Having come to myself, I looked round and was instantly dazzled. Three pairs of eyes were\nlooking at me – they had totally different colours and forms, but they were looking at me all absolutely\nintently. I was so embarrassed when all of them laughed that I even blushed up to the roots of my hair, I\ngot irritated and nearly angry, but the laughter of my friends was so kind-hearted – I was afraid that I\nlooked funny to them by being so dreamy – that I burst out laughing, too, remembering that I was Lovushka\n\n- the catcher of the crows.\n\n“Your dreams about Moscow, Lovushka,” Florentian was talking to me, “are rightful and\nneeded very much. Only you should be disposed that your goal isn’t your personal luck to meet your\nbrother, but to help him.”\n\nI was surprised once again that Florentian could read my thoughts. When I told him that I\nwas surprised at his ability to answer my unvoiced thoughts, he ensured me that there wasn’t anything\nspecial here, like his night conversation with the train’s conductor. And he told me that his wife was alive,\nthat he received an answer to his telegram in Samara.\n\nI felt how shallow my attention towards other people was in comparison to the deep\nattentiveness of Florentian. I had already forgotten both the conductor and his troubles.\n\nA conversation among the three of my new acquaintances started about our future actions\nin Moscow. Florentian was sure that our stay there would be burdened by the fanatics from K., that all their\nefforts would be directed to catch and force me to tell where my brother was and if he kidnapped Nal. He\nwas sure that the persecutors didn’t believe the legend about the people who were burnt down in my\nbrother’s house, or they burnt down somebody there themselves on occasion out of revenge. Therefore, he\nwas proposing all of us to stop at a single hotel. I and Florentian should take one of the rooms, while\nAnanda and Euclid had to stay from both of our sides. He told me strictly that I shouldn’t go anywhere\nalone and in the hotel I should be only together with one of them three. I didn’t quite understand how any\ndisaster could threaten me, but I promised to follow Florentian’s instructions. The time until the night\n\n\npassed unnoticed. I. told us something from his travelling in India, while Ananda remembered a terrible\nnight when he became a witness of a massacre in S. and where he succeeded to save one of the persecuted\nwomen whom they intended to kill with stones.\n\nThe night came. I was feeling tired from many new impressions and thoughts, so I went to\nbed earlier than others. I woke up, because Florentian was awakening me and I heard the words that\nsurprised me, although it seemed to me that I had gone to bed only an hour ago.\n\n```\n“We are approaching Moscow.”\n```\n\n# Chapter 8\n\n## One more sore disappointment and departure from Moscow\n\nWhen we climbed out of the carriage, the whole crowd of various employees met us. Having\nlined up in one long row, with the names of the hotels on their uniforms or their ordinary caps, with the\nliveries or without them, they were inviting the travellers, offering them coaches, calashes, light carriages...\n\nThe first, as though looking round, was going Ananda, in the middle I was going with\nFlorentian, while I. was following us. Our walk was ended by the porters with our suitcases.\n\nEverything was so interesting – the harsh cries of the hotel names being called, the bargains\nbetween the travellers and the whole crowd of coach-men who were dressed in blue long-waisted coats,\nwith the whips in their hands. Dozens of them were thronging round a traveller, so once again I forgot\neverything, I was only observing everything with amazement and I was already about to give a laugh and\nstop. Florentian pushed me slightly, I stopped gaping at sides instantly and noticed that one of the\nemployees of the hotels separated from the crowd. On his cap there was a French hotel inscription\n“National”, he greeted Ananda like a familiar guest by raising with respect his hand to his cap.\n\nIn several minutes we were already sitting in an excellent landau and rolling towards the city\ncentre.\n\nI hadn’t seen Moscow for a long time and, having compared it to Petersburg, I could see only\na dirty provincial city with rather low traffic. The streets along which we were driving were narrow, curved,\nmost of the houses were wooden and low. Lots of orthodox churches and chapels with the sound of their\nbells echoing from all sides seemed to me to be patriarchal. I thought for a while unwillingly by looking at\nthat great number of orthodox churches that Russian nation was very religious. I was asking myself if with\nits belief it could be so rudely fanatical like muslims were, who could only see their merit before God in\ntheir brutal behaviour.\n\nUnwittingly, my thoughts turned towards myself – what God meant to me, how I was living\nwith Him and within Him, my religion was impeding or helping me? With the whole secondary school going\nto an orthodox church once per week, I could see this only like a variation from our monotonous lives, I\nnever tried to seek for a facilitation of my troubles there, I didn’t complain to God, but while being in an\northodox church I used to observe everything.\n\nWe were driving in silence, exchanging some insignificant remarks from time to time, but I\nwas feeling instinctively that in everyone’s head the only thought was spinning – about my brother and\nNal’s destiny.\n\nHaving entered the lobby of the hotel, we ordered our rooms as we had decided beforehand.\nFlorentian asked if there was any correspondence in the name of the lord Benedict and, to my great\namazement, a respectable and well-built porter gave him two telegrams and two letters.\n\n“The letters for Your Lordship are waiting for two day, while one of the telegrams was\nreceived at night and another – just in this moment,” he added politely.\n\nI was impatient. When we settled in the room, as soon as the servant finished dawdling with\nour things and finally left, I rushed at Florentian and asked him if the letter wasn’t from my brother,\nbecause it seemed to me that I recognized his handwriting on one of the envelopes. He gave a smile and\n\n\nwas astonished, because by being so absent-minded I could recognize the handwriting of my beloved\nbrother from such a distance. Seeing my impatience, he took one of the letters, extended it to me and told\nme.\n\n“When Ali was talking to you in the garden, he warned you that not only help for your\nbrother, but also your, your brother’s and Nal’s lives depended on your courage, loyalty and self-control.\nNow, when you are reading the letter, think not about yourself, but only about that help which you can give\nto him.”\n\nMy heart was broken. My presentment was telling me that although I was hoping so much, I\nwouldn’t see my brother today.\n\nI read the letter once, I read it one more time, but my thoughts were still scattered, I was\nunable to draw any conclusion.\n\nMy brother was writing that they managed to leave K. unnoticed, that their servants dressed\nthemselves in Eastern women clothes, Nal – in European ones which were prepared by Ali, and that my\nbrother himself was travelling in the suit of a civilian. They were travelling in separate carriages until they\nreached Moscow. Here they changed their clothes and kept together from that moment on.\n\nIn Moscow they changed their trains to Petersburg successfully, because their friends had\nwarned them that they had to hurry, everything was already prepared, and the ship to London was leaving\non Sunday. So we didn’t have time to see each other in Moscow.\n\nMy brother was sending me his love and asking me to forgive for those troubles and\ndisappointments which he had given to me instead of a rest, he also was asking Florentian not to leave me\nif I miss the ship which he would be leaving with.\n\n```\n“Miss the ship,” I kept repeating this with sadness and vexation in my thoughts.\n```\n```\n“Sunday – that’s today,” finally I uttered to Florentian.\n```\nAgainst my will, I uttered this phrase with such a tone, as though I had returned from the\nfuneral and announced him about that.\n\n“Yes, that’s today. They managed to make off only because Ananda’s and Ali’s friends were\ntrying to distract the attention of the leaders of fanatics to deceptive tracks in every possible way,”\nFlorentian answered me. “But here’s the letter from Ali and two telegrams. We are being pursued. Mullah\nand the leaders decided that you would certainly go to your brother, so they want to find your tracks even\nif they are at the end of the world. If there’s an opportunity to seize you, they will hold an inquest about\nyour brother. By estimating your youth, they want to frighten and threaten you, and to find out everything\nwhat they need.”\n\n“So, even if there was a possibility, I couldn’t come with my brother anyway. In this case\nthere’s no need even to think about that,” I uttered, trying to drive away any outside thoughts and to think\nonly about the danger threatening my brother. “Now what we, and specifically me, are going to do? I’m\nfeeling great with you everywhere. Now all my life is only you. You will save my brother, I don’t have any\ndoubts about that. Dispose of my life as it seems to be necessary to you. I repeat once again, everything in\nmy life now – that’s you.”\n\n“You are the real brother, the real son of your brother-father. Believe me, you will be repaid\nwith great fortune in your life for this moment of heroism. The one who can act by forgetting himself, wins\nthe victory in the battle,” Florentian answered, embracing me tenderly. “In the letter, Ali warns us through\n\n\nhis friend who is living in Moscow that he would let us know via telegram if you are pursued. And indeed,\nthe first telegram is about that, while the second one informs us who are following us. That’s two young\ntraders who are ostensibly going to Moscow for goods. One of them doesn’t know any foreign language\nexcept Russian, while the other one knows German and English. Ali is writing that both of them are friends\nof Nal’s groom. One can predict their future actions and goals. Those things which Ali Machmed has given\nto Nal through you are not just things, and we must give them to her as soon as possible. I propose the\nfollowing plan for you. I myself will bring Nal’s things to her; today I will board the express Moscow – Paris\nand I will be in London sooner than they will be. Right now, in a couple of hours, I propose you with Euclid\nto go to Sevastopol, so you could come by sea to Constantinople and then you could travel to India, to Ali’s\nestate. I want to propose Ananda to justify himself with work and stay here for entire month, so he could\nkeep the connection with all of us and watch the enemy. I myself will be useful and even needful for your\nbrother and Nal who might get into a helpless situation without an experienced friend in the surroundings\ncompletely unknown to them. Besides, everyone needs to be convinced of your brother’s death, so that the\ndanger of pursuit wouldn’t threaten his life all the time. I also will come to India in three or four months,\nand after some time all of us will come to Paris where I intend to settle our fugitives when everything will\nsettle down.”\n\nI was listening to him in silence. No, that wasn’t even a petrification. It was rather similar to\nthat feeling which I had experienced in my brother’s room by the fireside, it was similar to what people\nexperience when their beloved die. I was as though standing by the deep grave and watching a coffin in it.\n\nI rose automatically, opened the suitcase where Nal’s things were placed and I started taking\nout my own things – every one of them was hurting me like a knife.\n\n“In all likelihood, you will want to take everything like Ali himself had put it. He gave this\nmoney to me. I don’t need it, because it’s not enough that much money for such a distant journey which\nyou are sending me to. Let it be the present to my brother. Buy a great case, a golden or silver little box in\nParis for the money and put his note-book in it, which I had forgotten in Ali’s house so carelessly,” I told\nFlorentian by giving him the wonderful note-book of my brother with the peacock. I’m ready for the\njourney already. Only let me go as the servant of I., so I could earn my bred which I was eating from my\nbrother’s hands up to now.”\n\n“My dear boy,” Florentian answered me, “when you come to India, you’ll be learning there.\nYou will know a lot and you will understand. Rely upon me up to then. Be not Euclid’s servant, but his\nfriend. Your talents for mathematics and music – that’s not everything what is hiding in you. You are feeling\na talent of a writer within you, aren’t you?”\n\nI blushed so that I even began to sweat. I never thought that he would notice my most\nsacred and hidden wish, too.\n\nThere was no time for any further conversation. Ananda and I. came in, and Florentian told\nthem about his further plan. I was very surprised, because they didn’t utter a word, both of them accepted\nhis proposal as not worthy of any discussion.\n\nAnanda called the servant of the hotel and asked him to order two tickets to Sevastopol and\nto take care of two people to get them to the train, and to bring breakfast to the room for everybody.\n\n```\n“And get one ticket for the evening train to Paris, too,” he added.\n```\n```\nAll of us put my things to Florentian’s travelling-bag which he gave as a gift to me.\n```\n\n“Here you will find a surprise from me,” he was explaining to me merrily. “As soon as you\nstart feeling a burial mood, then start looking for the surprise. And here’s my last precept: remember that\njoy is an invincible power, while melancholy and denial will destroy everything whatever you would set to\ndo.”\n\nOur breakfast was served, and the porter came, too. He told us that he had two tickets left to\nSevastopol in the international carriage, which he was about to return already when he heard about our\norder. We took the tickets at once, passed our things to the servant and sat down to have our breakfast. In\nhalf an hour I and I. had to go to the station already.\n\nI was fighting against myself as hard as I could, but I couldn’t swallow anything, although I\nhadn’t eaten anything from yesterday’s evening. My heart was aching. I became so attached to Florentian\nthat now, parting with him, I was as though burying my second father-brother. Everybody was trying not to\nnotice my sadness. A thought was spinning in my head – from where these people had so much selflessness\nand self-control? Why they were so restrained by helping so resolutely a totally stranger to them, my\nbrother? Where the axis of their lives was hiding, where that confident peace of them was coming from?\n\nAnd again a thought pierced my heart – what was “his own” and what was “a stranger” for a\nman. Florentian’s words were flashing that all people’s blood was of the same red colour and therefore, all\nof them were brothers, everybody had to try to carry beauty, peace and help.\n\nIn the kaleidoscope of my thoughts I didn’t even notice how our breakfast ended. Florentian\nstroked my head and uttered.\n\n“Lovushka, live in joy that your brother is alive, that you are sound and you can reflect. A\nthought-creation – that’s the only people’s happiness. Man who carries creation into his daily routine is\neverything. With your heroic love to your brother you’ve built the bridge not only to my heart, but here are\ntwo more of your loyal friends – that’s Ananda and Euclid.”\n\nI looked at him, but I couldn’t hold back my tears. I twined myself round his neck, he took me\nlike a kid on his arms and whispered to me.\n\n“The lessons of life aren’t easy for anybody. But here’s the first lesson to those who want to\nwin a victory – learn to smile carelessly while you are among people, although your heart is being pricked\nby needles. We will see each other, and Ananda will send you the news about me.”\n\nHe let me go by answering the knock at the door merrily. That was the porter who came to\ninvite us to go to the station.\n\nI and I. said good-bye to Florentian and Ananda by squeezing their hands sincerely, we\nfollowed the porter down-stairs, climbed into the coach and rolled towards the station. We were driving in\nsilence. Only when the coach stopped due to some event, I. asked the coach-man if we weren’t to be late.\nInstead of an answer, he only lashed the horses. As soon as we stepped into the carriage, the train was off.\n\n\n# Chapter 9\n\n## We are going to Sevastopol\n\nDuring this entire journey I spent so much time in the carriage that now, as soon as I got into\nit, I felt such strong dizziness that I had to lie down. I. took a little bottle out of his travelling-bag, poured\nseveral drops out of it into the glass of water and told me by giving the glass to me.\n\n```\n“When I was ill, Ananda always used to give me these drops.”\n```\nI drank the water. I was feeling better and I didn’t even notice when I felt into a light\nslumber.\n\nWhen I woke up, I. was standing by me and laughing that he was dying out of hunger and I\nwas sleeping for so long that he was already about to besprinkle me with water. It seemed to me that I was\nsleeping only for several minutes, while in fact it was already seven o’clock in the evening. We had to hurry\nto take our dinner, because everybody who had ordered their dinner in the second shift had already\nhurried and we could stay hungry. I dressed quickly, the conductor locked our compartment, and we went\nto the dining-car.\n\nHere was a totally different public than the one in the train coming to the border of Asia. The\nnewly opened line, express Moscow – Sevastopol was taking the rich public with great speed. They were\ncoming to the stylish resorts: Yalta, Gurzuf, Alupka and others. When we entered into the dining-car,\neverybody was already sitting in their places. The man-servant, having looked at our dinner order numbers,\ntook us to the little table where two ladies were sitting already.\n\nI became embarrassed at once, because I wasn’t used to ladies at all. Having looked at I., I\nwas surprised, because he was acting as if he had made court to them during his entire life. He took his hat\noff, bowed politely before the older lady and asked them in French.\n\n```\n“Can we join you at your table?”\n```\nThe lady gave a friendly smile, responded to his bow and answered him in an excellent\nFrench language with her low and pleasant voice.\n\n```\n“Yes, please.”\n```\nI. took our hats, put them into a little meshed shelf above the table and, having let me sit\ndown by the window, he sat down by the side, next to the aisle. I was feeling very uncomfortable, I was\ntrying to look through the window, but anyway, I was examining our neighbours stealthily.\n\nThe older lady who wasn’t yet old at all was dressed perfectly and elegantly. She had dark\nhair and dark eyes which were a little goggled, she must have been short-sighted. She was a little stout and,\njudging from her white and tended hands, she had never done any work with them, she could also hardly\nplay piano, because fingertips become wider due to constant work with the keys, and their skin becomes\nrougher. These hands were simply the hands of a lady. Her face wasn’t radiating neither intellect nor\ninspiration. I took a look at her teeth and lips – everything seemed to me to be a banal beauty, but that\nbeauty was poor, purely physical. She wasn’t interesting for me anymore.\n\n\nAt that moment a meat soup was served for us. I. explained to the man-servant that he had\nordered two vegetarian dinners. The man-servant apologized and hurried away to have it out with the\nmaitre d’hotel.\n\nThis misunderstanding served as a pretext for the conversation between the older lady and I.\nIt seemed to me that I. had made a strong impression on her. While the older ones were discussing about\nthe cons and pros of the vegetarian food, I focussed my attention on the second lady.\n\nShe was an absolutely young girl, almost a child. Visually she was no more than fifteen years\nold. She was blonde, her hair had the same golden hue like my brother’s, thus only because of this\nresemblance I had a liking for her. I was looking at her by taking advantage of her downcast eyes: her face\nwas thin, she had regular features and her forehead was high with the elevations above her eye-brows.\n\n“She has a musical talent,” I thought for myself.\n\nIt seemed that the girl was having the dinner in the dining-car for the first time. She was\ntrying very much not to spill the soup out of the spoon, but she had difficulties in doing so.\n\nHaving noticed that I was staring at the girl so tactlessly, I. asked me a question. He wanted\nto draw me into the joint conversation and to liberate the embarrassed neighbour from my looks. He\nlooked at me eloquently, and I understood at once that my behaviour didn’t suit the manners of a well-\nbred person.\n\nIt turned out that the older lady asked me to pass her the mustard that was standing by the\nwindow, and I didn’t hear her words. I. repeated her words to me, I got totally flustered, I passed the\nmustard to her and apologized in French, remembering my brother’s teaching that a courteous person\nshould answer in the same language which he was addressed with.\n\nThoughts flashed in my head not for the first time that it was very difficult to be a well-bred\nperson, lots of conditional knowledge was needed for this, but it was the essence of the great politeness.\n\nI. apologized to the older lady for my absent-mindedness, saying that I had just had a difficult\ndisease and that I hadn’t yet fully recovered. The lady was shaking her head sympathetically and she was\nthinking that I was I.’s son. She made me laugh because of this, and I. explained to her that I was his friend\nand a distant relative.\n\nI already wanted to ask her if the young lady was her daughter when she said herself that she\nwas taking her niece to Gurzuf where her sister, Lisa’s mother, had a villa by the sea.\n\nThe girl still kept silent. She didn’t raise her eyes, while her aunt kept telling us that Lisa had\njust graduated the secondary school, she was very tired after the examinations and that she had to have a\nrest peacefully.\n\n“Lisa is very gifted,” the lady continued, “she is very gifted for music and possesses an\nexcellent voice. She’s studying by the best Moscow’s professors, but her father is against the professional\nmusical education, and that’s the entire drama of Lisa’s life.”\n\nAnd then something unbelievable happened. All of a sudden Lisa raised her eyes, looked at\neverybody of us and fastened her eyes upon I.\n\n“Don’t believe a single word of my aunt. She doesn’t understand what she’s talking and she’s\nready to blurt out everything till the end to the first person that she meets,” she told us with her trembling\nand silent, but so melodious voice that I understood at once that she should sing really nicely.\n\n\nSpots began to shine in Lisa’s cheeks, her eyes were full of tears. It seemed that she hated\nher aunt and that she was struggling with her temper. At once I. poured some drops into the water from his\nlittle bottle and gave it to her by whispering silently, but very masterfully.\n\n“Drink it off. This will soothe you instantly.”\n\nThe girl obeyed him instantly. She really calmed down in several minutes. The red spots\nvanished from her cheeks, she gave a smile to me and asked me where I was going. I answered her that at\nthe moment I was going to Sevastopol and that I didn’t know my future itinerary. Lisa was surprised and\nshe explained to us that she thought that we were going to Alushta or Feodosia, because the Greeks were\nliving namely there in most cases.\n\n“The Greeks?” I was very surprised. “What the Greeks have to do with it here?”\n\nIn her turn, Lisa opened her grey eyes wide and told us that my relative was so typical Greek\nthat he could be a model of a Greek statue. Me and I., we were laughing merrily, while her aunt gave a sour\nsmile and told us that Lisa, like all people who were gifted for music, had no balance and that she had too\nwide imagination.\n\nI. was arguing with her, trying to prove her that talented people were not any patients of\nnerves, but on the contrary, they would be able to create and they would be valued by their\ncontemporaries when they find within themselves so much fortitude and loyalty for their idolized art that\nthey would be able to absolutely forget themselves, their nerves and their personal striving for honour and\nthen they would joyously spread their talent to the people surrounding them with great peace and self-\ncontrol. The aunt stated that those things were too high for her, while Lisa pricked up her ears, her eyes\nbegan to glitter and she told I.\n\n“Now I can understand so much. Your words are so clear and close to me, as though I had\ntold them to myself many times.”\n\nOne could see that she wanted to ask him many questions and that her young heart has set\non fire. She was a total contrast to her aunt: in the beginning of the dinner she was so pleasant, she kept\npeeking at I. coquettishly, but now she could hardly suppress her boredom and annoyance.\n\n“You should become acquainted with my sister. She always has her head in the clouds and\nshe doesn’t see or notice anything in her life except her flowers, music and books,” and she added a little\nmore silently, but more stingingly, “she doesn’t notice even what is going on just around the corner.”\n\n```\nEnvy distorted aunt’s face, it seemed that it was eating her heart out for a long time.\n```\nLisa turned pale so much, - even her reddish lips, - that I was frightened and I quickly\nextended a glass of water for her, but the girl didn’t even notice it. Her darkened eyes became hollow at\nonce, dark shadows appeared below them, and there wasn’t even a single sign of her childishness left.\nLooking straight into the eyes of her aunt with hateful look, she began to speak silently, clearly, as if cutting\nwith the knife.\n\n“One can do shabby tricks if one has a turn for it. One can be stupid if something is missing in\none’s brain; but to reveal your envy to the first person that you meet – you have to be more than stupid in\norder to do that. You’ve poisoned my mother’s youth and my childhood. You’ve been trying to interfere\nbetween my father and us during all your life. You failed to do that, because my father is an honest man\nand he loves me and my mother. Have you really accepted my and my mother’s delicacy and sympathy for\nyou as our short sight or stupidity? I would have kept it to myself now, too, but your impudence is simply\nrevolting.”\n\n\nIt is difficult to render how aunt changed. There wasn’t a single sign of her entire beauty and\nher outer brilliance of a “lady” left. At once an old woman who couldn’t control her fury anymore and who\nwas spitting nasty words in silence was sitting in front of us.\n\n“You girl, fool, wicked spy, good-for-nothing. I will avenge you. I will tell everything to your\nfather and grandfather.”\n\nThe girl took a pleading look at I. In spite of the rumble of the wheels and the noise of the\nventilators, the curious looks were already turning to the direction of our table. I. invited the man-servant,\npaid up, took our hats, looked at the aunt up and down masterfully and told her very silently, but in a\ncommanding way.\n\n“Stand up and let your niece go by. Now there will be a station, we’ll go to the platform with\nher. Come to your compartment through carriages. Recover a human semblance, because you aren’t\nyourself anymore. Try to hide your fury behind a smile from the strangers.”\n\nWhile he was talking like this, he was standing in front of her in a respectful posture, handing\nher the fallen handbag and gloves.\n\nNot uttering a single word to him, she stood up and went to the exit by manoeuvring among\nthe tables and not waiting for us.\n\nI. helped Lisa to come out of the table, because it was quite narrow here. He went forward\nand let the girl go through the door. By following them I lagged behind a little: I wanted to be alone, I\nwanted to make sense of that strange life, the curtain of which was lifted so unexpectedly and in a nasty\nway for me, but I. stopped, he waited for me to come closer and explained to me.\n\n“My friend, don’t retreat a step from me. Whatever dramas or pleasures happen along our\npath, we mustn’t forget our main goal.”\n\nHe took my arm, and the three of us walked along the platform a couple of times, boarding\nthe carriage after the second bell already.\n\nHow I was surprised when in the corridor of our carriage I saw the aunt who was merrily\nflirting with a not too old general. It turned out that our places were two compartments one from another.\n\nAs if nothing had happened, the aunt addressed us, saying that she already started worrying\nif we didn’t kidnap her niece. I. answered in her tone that neither he nor I were similar to the romantic\nkidnappers, but that we were very happy if, according to her opinion, we had an appearance of the\nphilanderers.\n\nHaving bowed very politely, we said good-bye to aunt and her niece. I also tried to sparkle\nwith elegance of my manners. I. told Lisa that he would give her the promised book through the conductor.\n\nIt seemed that it was very terrible for the poor girl to part with us. Her little face that was\nthin already fell even more.\n\nWhen we stepped into our compartment, I wanted to talk about our new acquaintances, but\nI. interrupted me.\n\n“It is not worth talking about them now. Both of us who’ve suffered lots of pain in our lives\nhave to reconsider every uttered word. There are no such words which man could let into the world\nwithout any effect. Man’s entire life – that’s the eternal movement; and that movement is created by\nman’s thoughts. A word isn’t a simple combination of letters. It always transfers the power of man’s action.\n\n\nEven if man himself doesn’t know anything about the powers hiding within himself and if he doesn’t think\nwhat kind of volcanoes of passions and evil he can create and awaken with his incautiously slipped word –\neven then there are no sounds released to the world without any punishment. Beware of any slanders not\nonly with your words, but even in your thoughts try to justify people and to pour peace onto them at least\nin that moment when you meet them. Let’s rather think what our friends are doing right now. Perhaps\nFlorentian is already boarding the Paris train, while Ananda is accompanying him.”\n\nIt seemed that he projected himself into the distant Moscow, his look became vacant, while\nhe was sitting motionless with his head rested against the back of the sofa. I thought for a while that every\nman probably had his own habit to sleep, while up to now I hadn’t even paid any attention to which way\neveryone was sleeping. Florentian was sleeping like a dead person, I. was sleeping with his eyes opened,\nbut also as deep as Florentian.\n\nWhile thinking that it also was impossible and it didn’t make any sense to wake up I., I\nprojected myself to Moscow in my thoughts, too.\n\nNow, for the first time during all those days having said good-bye to Florentian for a long\ntime, to whom I had attached with my entire heart, I felt the power of disappointment and blow of my life\ndelivered to me with this separation. From my very birth until that moment when I parted with my brother,\nI could see the only light in my way, my only own home, my only loyal friend – my brother Nikolay. Now I’m\nseparated from my brother – my light is put out, there’s no my home left and my friend disappeared. While\nI was next to Florentian, in spite of the danger threatening to me or sorrow because of my brother,\nregardless of being homeless, I still was feeling and I perceived that he was the light, home and a friend to\nme. When I was next to him, a feeling of absolute security and peace in my heart would always arise even\nwhen I used to cry or to be in a rage. I was certain, I was sure during every moment of my life that\nFlorentian wasn’t only a home to me, but that by studying and improving in that home I would be able to\nlive in such a way that I would be worthy of my friend.\n\nNow, while thinking that Florentian was going to Paris and I was going to the East, although\nto other places, but still to the same East which has given so much pain to me, I perceived how homeless\nand lonely I was, flung down by the destiny to the whirls of passions. I could be only a little toy in the hands\nof those powers, because I hadn’t only seen or experienced anything, but I hadn’t even succeeded to\neducate and prepare myself for life.\n\nNot a single string in my organism was in tune as much as that I could rely upon it. I used to\ncry and to be lost like a small child from every stroke into my heart. My body was weak, not tempered by\nany kind of gymnastics, any tension would stir my feebleness and fainting-fit, and taking into account my\nself-control and endurance, precision of my thoughts and lucidity – there was even less discipline within me\nhere.\n\nI was looking through the window. The dark was getting thicker. Nature was spurted with its\npowers. Green grasslands, floating fields of crops, picturesque little villages were flashing before my eyes.\nEverything was telling me about the real life! All those fields, gardens and kitchen-gardens were close and\ndear to somebody. People were working here in the entire families, finding love not only for their loved\nones, but also the joint feeling for this land, its wealth and its creative work.\n\nAnd I was so lonely, so lonely... lonely everywhere I go! And I don’t have neither a corner nor\na heart in the entire world where I could feel a shelter for myself.\n\nWhile being immersed in these bitter thoughts, I forgot both I. and where I was, I projected\nmyself into the world of the dreams, I started thinking how I would try to become worthy of Florentian’s\n\n\nfriendship, how I would become as strong, kind and always self-controlled as him. Unwittingly my thoughts\nskipped to his friends I. and Ananda. I was stunned by their great nobility, by their deeds full of self-denial\nwhen they left off everything after hearing Florentian’s invitation and came to help me and my brother –\nthe people who were total strangers to them.\n\nAll of a sudden a racket in the corridor interrupted my dreams. I could hear the cries:\n“Doctor, doctor quickly!”\n\nHaving broken away from my thoughts, suddenly I jumped up, because I wanted to help the\nwomanly voice which was crying for help. I caught my foot on the suitcase that was standing by the little\ntable, and I would have measured my entire length on the floor with my face down if the strong hands of I.\nhadn’t seized me by my shoulders from behind.\n\n“Lovushka, you’ll hurt your nose,” I. told me by imitating a pretty old mumbling in a very\nfunny way.\n\nIt was so unexpected and ridiculous, it didn’t suit I.’s seriousness so much that I roared with\nlaughter, having forgotten where and why I was running.\n\n“Wait for me here, my friend,” he said to me already with his usual voice. “I’ll go alone with\nmy drops. I recognize the hysterical voice of our older neighbour. I may be delayed there, but you don’t\nleave the compartment until I come back. Think only about our main goal during all that time. Florentian\nleft to Paris already. According to the time, his train started ten minutes ago,” he told me, having looked at\nthe clock. “Florentian left only because of you and your brother, right? I’m going only because of you and\nhim. Ananda stayed in Moscow only because of both of you. How could you name yourself lonely and\nhomeless?”\n\nIt was heard a knock at the door of our compartment at this moment. I. kissed my forehead\ntenderly and opened the door.\n\nThe general, whom Lisa’s aunt was flirting with when we were returning to the carriage, and\na youth were standing behind the door. The general apologized for disturbing us and asked for doctor’s\nhelp for the young girl from the adjacent compartment, - he was clearly taking I. for the doctor, - because\nher aunt was unable to bring her to her senses for more than half an hour already, although she was using\nall possible means.\n\nNot denying that he wasn’t a doctor, I. asked them why they didn’t take his advice up to\nnow. He took a travelling first-aid kit from the travelling-bag which Florentian gave to me and left with the\ntwo passengers who were asking for his help.\n\nI took a peep at the corridor. It was full of men and women, split from all sides. They looked\nfunny: everyone’s face was lost and asking questions, while everybody was holding a little bottle in their\nhands. It seemed that before looking for a doctor they were trying to help the poor aunt to revive the girl.\n\nI closed my compartment and the suitcase on which I caught my foot so awkwardly, I lifted it\nup on the shelf and started thinking about the girl who fainted away so strongly.\n\nI remembered her thin little face and her slender, almost childish figure. It seemed to me\nthat her health wasn’t too strong, as mine, that she also was unable to control herself and that she was\npoorly educated, in other words, she didn’t have any self-control, like me. “Well,” I was thinking, “she has\nboth her father and mother, she has home, even two of them, because she’s going to the villa by the sea,\nand her life is hardly any happier than mine if she has to live with her hated aunt while she’s travelling.”\n\n\nI was trying to imagine her house, surroundings, even her inner life, I wanted to understand\nhow a child living with her parents could come to such heartache; how the way of living of her parents had\nto oppress her day by day if Lisa could lay bare her soul before the total strangers like today.\n\nI was comparing her with myself. Having remembered the words which I. recently told me, I\nwas trying to throw her troubles over onto my own shoulders, from the bottom of my heart I was looking\nfor a justification for her deed. I remembered my own tears of the last days, how bitterly I was crying in\npresence of the strangers to me, and I was a man, at least five years older than she was.\n\nAnd again a boring question was turning round in my head, which was flashing through my\nmind like a leitmotif during all these days: “Who were your own people to you? Who were the strangers to\nyou?” That distracted my thoughts from the girl’s life.\n\nAfter some time I came back to her. Did I like Lisa? I had never been in love during my entire\ntwenty years. I was so occupied, I had to do so much homework, to write so many compositions, to read so\nmany books. My brother was sending lots of programs in his letters to me – what I had to read, what\nmuseums and galleries to visit – all of that would fill up my brains and I always used to be occupied. I didn’t\nhave any acquaintances, except my old aunt, and in her home I would always meet only old and dignified\nladies, and each of them would always teach me good manners by extending their perfumed and wrinkled\nhands to kiss, being unconcerned about the morose boy’s life, which of course, I looked like to them. All of\ntheir talking were only about aristocracy’s life: which ball they had visited at one or another countess and\nwhich duke had invited them for tomorrow.\n\nI had never had a chance to sit down with the girls at one table or to dance with them, like\nmy friends used to tell me about it. Lisa was the first girl with whom I was sitting at one table for nearly an\nhour. She was an ordinary, everyday girl, while Nal had opened a higher beauty, a higher and not everyday\nlife to me, with whom fate had brought me together. And I could look at both of them not only like at my\nwell known acquaintances, but I could also see a little of their spiritual life that was invisible to others.\n\nThe whirls of thoughts were spinning in my head, the scenes were changing like on the\nscreen: “Lisa was reproaching her aunt for telling about her troubles to the first person she met, but didn’t\nshe say even more than her aunt?”\n\nI felt tenderness for Lisa. A wish was growing in me to help her as much as I could, to ease\nher life.\n\nApparently lots of time had passed while I was busy with these psychological etudes. The\nnight was already showing black behind the window, the candles were burning in the carriage, but it was\ndark in the compartment anyway.\n\nI stood up and wanted to take a peep at the corridor, but suddenly there came a knock at the\ndoor and I saw I. who was taking Lisa into our compartment. It seemed that she was unable to walk herself;\nher aunt was standing behind them with a plaid in her hands.\n\n“Lovushka, Lisa had a strong heart attack. Until the bed is being prepared in her\ncompartment, she will have to lie at our place for a while, because she cannot sit down,” I. was talking to\nme, while laying the girl down on the sofa.\n\nI wanted to go to the corridor, but he squeezed a crystal bottle into my hand and told me to\ngive it to Lisa to smell every five minutes. I sat down on the suitcase at the bed-head and started playing a\ndoctor’s assistant. I. showed to aunt the chair by the little table, took the plaid from her hands, covered the\ngirl with it and sat down by her feet.\n\n\nThe silence prevailed for several minutes. I didn’t see the aunt, because while being occupied\nwith my medical mission I was sitting with my back turned to her. Taking advantage of Lisa’s state, I could\ninspect her attentively.\n\nOf course, she was a beautiful girl, but I was stunned mostly because one of her cheeks was\nas pale as the wax, while the other one wasn’t only burning, but its redness was already turning into a big\nbruise that I could see clearly now, because I. found the travelling candle-stick and, having lit the candle,\nput it on the little table.\n\n```\n“Why are you crying now?” all of a sudden I heard I.’s voice.\n```\nHaving turned round, I saw aunt’s face that was wet because of her tears; her nose, lips and\ncheeks – everything grew fat and flabby, and she looked very repulsive.\n\n“I’m crying not because of the girl, but because of my own fate. What will happen to me\nnow? She’ll be persuading everybody that I pushed her, but in truth she hurt herself...” the aunt answered\nhim with an angry voice, while sobbing.\n\nI was surprised when I looked at I., because his expression was very austere. He was looking\nat the crying woman so intently that he reminded me the burning eyes of Ali. I would have never believed\nthat I.’s face could be so austere and his eyes so strict, because I. was always so restrained, he was mostly\nradiating kindness.\n\n“It would be best for you to tell the truth. Both of us know very well that neither Lisa has\nhurt herself nor you have pushed her – you’ve hit her, not evaluating your strength, and I can show you all\nfive fingerprints of yours on her face. If you had struck her a little higher, it would have been deadly for\nLisa,” I. was speaking with a sonorous voice.\n\n```\nAunt’s sobbing stopped, and her voice in a furious wheeze could be heard in silence.\n```\n“You may be a doctor, but you can hardly understand what you are talking now. I’m a weak\nwoman, how could I hit the girl so that she could even faint away? I’m telling you that she’s fallen down\nherself, and I didn’t have enough strength to lift her up.”\n\n“That’s why you’ve pinched her entire chest and her hand,” I. was talking. “So because\nyou’re denying that you’ve beaten her up, I will have to take some pictures and to give the photographs to\nthe jurists as soon as we come to Sevastopol.”\n\n```\nThe silence didn’t continue for a long time. The aunt whispered.\n```\n```\n“How much will you take for your silence?”\n```\n```\nI. gave a laugh, I also couldn’t help but to give a laugh and I screamed.\n```\n```\n“But this is the real novel!”\n```\nMy laugh must have irritated the lady very much, who looked so ugly and old now, because\nwhen I looked at her – I was as though bitten by a snake – so angry her eyes were.\n\n“I’m not trading with my conscience and I don’t take any bribes for my services. You’ve\naffected the girl with your blow both physically and morally. You’ll be responsible for your moral blow\nbefore your life, it will respond to you from that side from where you’re expecting it the least. You’ll get the\nsame slap in your face from your own child like you’ve done it to the stranger, and for your physical blow\nyou’ll be responsible in the court and you’ll get what you deserve,” I. was speaking so by taking the camera\nfrom the suitcase on which I was sitting.\n\n\n“Take a pity on me. I don’t know why this angry girl told you about my son, but he’s the only\ntreasure in my life. Don’t kill me. I’ve hit her for the first time, because she betrayed me to you. Take a pity\non poor mother,” she was mumbling with a changed voice.\n\n“Why didn’t you take a pity on the only child of your sister? Your sister is unfortunate,\nbecause her only misfortune up to now is you,” I. continued, still looking at your strictly.\n\n“You are still very young. You don’t know poverty. You cannot neither understand nor judge\nme,” the woman was talking pitifully. “But if you don’t betray me to Lisa’s parents, then I swear by my son’s\nlife that I won’t touch this girl again.”\n\n“And you’ll keep eating your sister’s bread, you’ll keep living from her favour by pretending\nto be a mistress of their home and you’ll prick and hurt your sister’s and Lisa’s hearts uninterruptedly? Oh\nno, you value too much your son’s wellbeing and you don’t value the lives of three of your relatives at all.\nOnly then I’m able not to betray you if you can leave your sister’s home.”\n\n“Where will I go? You are talking like this, because you’ve never seen any misery and you\ndon’t understand life. What will I live on?” the irritated aunt was asking him.\n\nFor the second time already, a hardly visible smile slipped through I.’s face and I, like before,\nthought that this was only a play of the shadow of the candle’s flame.\n\n```\n“You have to get to work,” he answered her silently.\n```\n“To work? One can see at once that you haven’t earned a penny in your life, as well as your\nbrother who’s been a burden to your parents, and you don’t understand what you’re talking about,” the\nwoman was snorting in anger.\n\n“I repeat to you once again,” I. contradicted her emphatically and calmly, but with an\nunshakable will, “that the only condition under which I will agree to hide your sin and at the same time to\naccept a part of your crime to myself, - you have to leave your sister’s home immediately and get to work.\nYou must earn your living yourself and teach your son to do the same.”\n\n“I’m not a cook or a governess so that I would earn my living myself. I’m a lady, do you hear\nme, a la – dy! I was, I am and I will be a lady!”\n\n“It would be enough for you to take a look at yourself in the mirror now, so that you would\nmake sure that you aren’t a lady in that sense in which one should understand the privileges of this word,\nthat is in the sense of high culture, self-control and inner discipline,” I. answered her.\n\n“You are very impudent and self-confident man. I won’t go anywhere and I’m not afraid of\nyou,” the aunt was screaming.\n\n“Oh, if you could understand that you should be afraid only of yourself. Then you could\nprotect your son from all misfortunes, you would lead him to people, and he wouldn’t have, in your\nexample, to become a dependent and later a good-for-nothing person. You are afraid of losing the shelter\nof your sister, which you’ve poisoned yourself, but understand at last that I’m not threatening you, I’m not\nfrightening you, I will only let your relatives know everything about you. They won’t bear you in their home\nthemselves, and you will stay on the street. If you leave at your own will, I promise to find a job for you. You\nhave to understand at last that everyone must work, and especially you.”\n\n```\n“But I cannot be a governess,” she screamed again.\n```\n\n“Nobody would even think about allowing you to approach children. You don’t possess even\na primary understanding about what tact is, and a tactless person, even if she’s the best, is hurting a child\nlike a bad, poisoned weather. I could give you a letter to Moscow to one of my friends. He’s in a very broad\nliterature business and he needs translators. He’s paying very generously. By the way, his institution\noccupies the whole house in which there may be a little flat for you and your son. Until you haven’t eaten a\nsingle bit of your own earned bread, you cannot even understand what happiness it is to live on the earth.\nOnly an honest job can bring happiness.”\n\nThe aunt remained silent. I turned around several times, and it seemed to me that I.’s words\nhad really calmed her down a little. Her eyes weren’t pouring any hatred anymore, her irritated and\ndistorted by anger face calmed down, even a nobility flashed in it, like a sunbeam penetrating through the\ngrey veil of the rain.\n\nLisa was still fainted away. I. stood up, bent his head over the girl and wiped a lock off her\nburning cheek. Her cheek swelled up, the marks of the beating could be seen on it and the bruise had\nturned black. I. took the camera, but when he wanted to open it already, the aunt hold his hand and\nuttered silently.\n\n```\n“I agree to start working.”\n```\nI was stunned. Several times during these days I became a witness how passions,\ndrunkenness, parasitism, fanatical hatred, envy were spoiling people, splitting them and making them\nenemies, how they would lose their human form and would become the victims of their own anger and\nrage. I was reflecting with bitterness that my own self-control and discipline were absolutely poor, too, and\nhow I used to calm down solely when my brother, Florentian or my new friend I. were close to me.\n\nI. didn’t utter a single, even the most bitter word in a high tone, not a slightest hint of\ncontempt to the aunt sounded in his speech. Only the greatest benevolence was both in his face and voice.\nEven the angry screams of the aunt, which insulted me for my friend, so that I even wanted to meddle into\nthe conversation and respond in her intonation, didn’t disturb the noble peace of I. and his sympathy to the\nwoman.\n\nI. looked at her. That look must have touched the best strings of her living being; she covered\nher face with her hands and whispered.\n\n“Forgive me. I have such a mad character that sometimes I don’t understand what I say or do\nmyself. But if I pledge my word, - then I keep it honestly. And that may be my only value,” she was talking\nthrough the tears that were pouring again.\n\n“Don’t cry, but take a look at everything what has happened now as seriously as possible.\nThank fate that Lisa didn’t fall down from your blow and that she didn’t hit her head into a sharp corner of\nthe table; if this also had been added to your blow, then you would be a murderess now, and you\nunderstand perfectly what that would mean to you, your son and Lisa’s parents,” I. answered her.\n\nA terror was reflected in the woman’s face. Now she was so unhappy that even my heart\nbecame softer. I was trying to find a justification for her, I was imagining how a person was decaying,\ngradually not noticing it, solely because of the trap of envy, which she was making every day.\n\n“Don’t come back to the past in your thoughts,” I. began to speak again. “Think about your\nson, that he could have gotten into such situation like Lisa. There’s nothing what a mother’s love couldn’t\novercome. I will cure Lisa’s cheek, there won’t be a single mark left from the bruise in several hours, but\nyou’ll have to keep watch by her till the very morning by changing the compresses with the liquid that I\n\n\ngave you. Take these strengthening drops, and your sleepless night will go by easily. In the morning I will\nwrite a letter to my friend and give you some money, so that from this moment on you could start a new\nindependent life and leave with your son, not running into debt to your sister anymore. When you are\nearning good money already, you can repay your master, and he will send the money to me. Don’t fall into\ndespair when you want to scream again: “I’m a lady, I was, I am and I will be a lady,” but go to another\nroom, so no one could see you, and remember this night. Remember how I was telling you that for all your\ncreated evil your son would return a hundred fold to you, but also every moment of your true kindness,\nendurance and self-control would build a bridge to happiness for your son.”\n\nAll kinds of feelings were probably breaking the woman’s heart and her strength were\nabandoning her already. I. told me to pour some water into the glass, he put some drops into it and gave it\nto the aunt.\n\nOnce again Florentian took a bottle from the same travelling-bag, a big glass and asked me to\nbring some warm water from the conductor.\n\nWhen I came back into the compartment, aunt had already come to life and helped I. to\nwake up Lisa. Her movements were careful, even gentle, while her thin and older face had taken the\nexpression of great sadness and determination. That wasn’t already that woman at all, whom I saw during\nthe dinner, and not that one whom I had just left when I left the compartment. In truth I didn’t find the\nconductor instantly, because he was busy with the passengers’ bedding, I also didn’t get the water\ninstantly, because it had to be cooled off, so maybe it took me some twenty minutes, - and after that much\ntime I didn’t recognize the girl...\n\nSo many different events had happened during those days, and I was changing the most of\neverybody, because I wasn’t surprised by this change anymore, it seemed to me that it had to be like this.\n\nI. gave some medicine to drink to Lisa, he and her aunt laid her again and in several minutes\nshe opened her eyes. In the beginning her eyes were without any expression, then having recognized I., she\nbecame radiant with joy, but having seen her aunt, she gave a shout as though someone had burnt her.\n\n“Calm down my friend,” I. addressed her. “Nobody is going to hurt you again. I’ll soon put\nthe compress on your cheek and until morning any tracks of beating will be gone. Don’t look at your aunt\nwith such horror and hatred. Don’t think that the greatest man’s nobility is to fence himself off those who\nseem to be angry to us, whom we are calling our enemies. The enemy must be conquered, but we must do\nit not passively by retreating from him, but with an active fight, with a heroic strain of our thoughts and\nfeelings. A talented person whom life has fated to bring the drop of his creative efforts into the whole\nactivity of mankind, mustn’t take pleasure in being idle, not to experience any storms, suffering, he must\nfight both with himself and the people living in the neighbourhood. Now you are stepping into life so that\nyou would become a valuable and full member of the society. If now you aren’t able to find the great\nnobility within yourself not to betray your aunt for her evil, you won’t bring that great capital of honour and\nsympathy into your own life, which would help you to create a new and joyous life both for yourself and\nyour loved ones in the future. Don’t judge your aunt as the judge would do, but think about the passions\nthat are hiding within yourself. Remember how often you were hate filled for her and her son, although he\nreally isn’t to blame for your bad luck and relations with your aunt. How often you used to repay her for her\nroughness with even greater roughness, how during all that time you used to find a chance to put her to\nshame publicly by “putting her in her own place” in your thoughts. Not a single kind feeling for her has ever\nflashed within you, although you are kind to others, very kind. The youth is sensitive. You are still unable to\nimagine the entire life’s complexity, the whole power of man’s passions, which is laying traps in every step,\nbut to understand that man’s power – that’s not his anger, but his kindness, that nobility which he’s\npouring from himself into his daily routine and with which he ties people together with himself – that you\n\n\ncan do, because your heart is pure and receptive. Since you are talented, you play violin, then you\nunderstand that the sounds – just like the kindness – are fascinating people with their beauty and uniting\nthem with you. By playing the violin, you are inviting them into beauty, you don’t feel any fear. Exactly so,\nnow go to your compartment without any fear and doubts. When the heart is really opened to beauty, it\ndoesn’t feel any fear and it is singing a wonderful song – the song of love defeating everything. You are so\nyoung and pure that your heart is unable to sing any other song. Don’t think about the past; live in this\n“now” moment with your heart full of the best feelings and you will create a wonderful life both for\nyourself and your loved ones. If today you are unable to find the strength to open your heart to real love\nand honour without any compromises, then your “tomorrow” will be polluted with your own remains of\nbile and bitterness. Your aunt will leave instantly as soon as she takes you home. She has found a place for\nherself and she would be living in Moscow with her son, and you are planning to move to Petersburg, right?\nYou feel better now. Lovushka will take you up to your compartment and he will give you to drink this\nmixture that will help you to have a good sleep and tomorrow you will be as graceful as the rose,” I. added\nsmiling.\n\nLisa was very surprised by everything what she heard. It was clear for everybody that now a\nconfusion was in her head, but I.’s words weren’t uttered in vain.\n\n“I understood you very well. However strange it may sound, but my mother would often talk\nto me in a very similar way, therefore your words surprised me mostly, because they absolutely matched\nmy mother’s ideas, although you expressed them in a totally different way. I really hate my aunt, I don’t\nbelieve in any of her words. You cannot even imagine how she can lie.”\n\n```\n“And are you so irreproachably correct?” I. asked her silently.\n```\n“No,” Lisa answered him, blushing very much. “Not at all, but... But why should I rummage in\nthe past? If you told me that she would leave,” she put a strong stress on the word “she”, “then I believe\nyou. That’s all we need.”\n\n“No,” I. told her again, “that’s absolutely not all what you need, so that you would be happy.\nYou are so used to always have a live pretext to complain of your misfortunes that it has already become\nyour habit. Instead of observing yourself you were observing your aunt by searching for causes of your\ndisasters within her, not even noticing that not only her, but yourself, too, Lisa, have become a tormentor\nof your mother, father, aunt and... even yourself.”\n\n```\nHaving heard the last I.’s words, Lisa lowered her head.\n```\n```\n“That’s true,” she uttered finally by looking straight into I.’s eyes.\n```\nI. helped her to stand up, he gave me the big glass for compresses and the small one with\nmixture and offered Lisa to go to have a good sleep by leaning on my arm, so that she could meet her\ngrandfather in the morning refreshed and with a smile.\n\nIt was after midnight already. I and aunt took Lisa to their compartment, I gave her the\nmixture which she drank off instantly, I left the big glass for compresses to her aunt and, having wished\nthem good night, I came back to I.\n\nI found him in the corridor, because the conductor was making the bed for us. I stood next to\nhim, he explained to me in English that I should go to sleep, because tomorrow would require lots of\nstrength from me, and I looked tired. He still had to write a couple of letters and he could go to sleep only\nafter finishing them.\n\n\nI already knew from my short experience that he wouldn’t start any conversation about the\nlatest events, so I gave him a bow not contradicting, I perched on the upper shelf and as soon as I took my\nclothes off, I fell sound asleep.\n\nI woke up from the knocking at our compartment’s door and I.’s voice, answering the\nconductor that we were already getting up and that we were thankful for his care. When I got down I saw\nthat I.’s bedding wasn’t touched, three sealed envelopes were put on the table, and he had put a light grey\nsuit on.\n\nHe asked me to collect all of our belongings, having told me that he would visit Lisa again,\nwhom he visited a couple of times at night. He also explained to me that the girl’s organism was strong, but\nher nervous system was so weak that she would still need a constant and careful supervision, therefore he\nasked her aunt to tell him their last name and he wrote a letter to Lisa’s mother, countess R. with the\ninstruction on how she had to treat and educate her daughter.\n\nI don’t know if I was standing like this for a long time with my characteristic absent-\nmindedness and ability to forget everything around me in one moment, but suddenly the door opened and\nI heard the merry I.’s voice.\n\n“You will ruin us, Lovushka! We must get everything as soon as possible, we are in\nSevastopol already.”\n\nI became ashamed, I dashed to collect our belongings, but I. was doing everything faster and\nbetter than me, so I just had to give him our things. We didn’t have time to close our suitcases, and the\ntrain was already standing in the platform.\n\nI saw Lisa and her aunt in the corridor. Both of them had white splendid dresses and elegant\nhats on. Lisa really looked like a life-giving rose, and a joy was shining in her eyes. Her aunt was pale, her\nface was sad, a new wrinkle had cut in between her eyes, although yesterday her forehead was still flat; her\nlips were pressed together tightly, but it was strange – now I liked her much more. There was nothing left\nfrom her yesterday’s vivacity, she had become an elderly woman with the face marked by suffering.\n\nI greeted both of them from the distance: I didn’t have any want to take a deeper look into\nthe drama of these lives. Sevastopol reminded me at once that here we would embark a ship and travel to\nthe East. At the same time also my thoughts about my brother and his destiny at this moment came back to\nme.\n\nA well-dressed public was descending from our carriage, and not worse dressed people were\ngreeting them on the platform... There were merry voices, laughter, embracing. A thought pierced me\nthrough again that there was no one in the whole world who could meet me, to press me to his breast,\nalthough there were millions of people living on the earth.\n\nI. took my arm and looked into my eyes reproachfully as it seemed to me. In a moment we\nwere already following the porter to the platform where Lisa was waiting for us, holding her grandfather by\nhand. That was a very handsome, proud and elegant man. He was tall and he had a short, grey, pointed\nlittle beard.\n\nLisa brought him to I. and explained to him that she tumbled so unfortunately in the carriage\nthat she bruised her left cheek and temple, while doctor I. helped her so much with his mixtures that there\nwasn’t a sign left from the bruise.\n\n\nBeing frightened of his granddaughter’s ailment, the grandfather thanked I. very much, he\nwas asking where we were going and told us that here he had a reserve coach and that he could take us to\nGurzuf. I. thanked him and explained that we were staying in Sevastopol.\n\n“In this case let my coach-man to deliver you to the best hotel,” he told us by lifting his hat\nup a little.\n\nI saw that I. didn’t want to accept grandfather’s gratitude, but we didn’t have anything to do.\nHe also lifted his hat up a little, took a bow and thanked him for the service.\n\n\n# Chapter 10\n\n## In Sevastopol\n\nAll of us left the station’s building. Grandfather told our porter to find Ibrahim from Gurzuf in\nthe crowd of the coach-men.\n\nSoon a great coach harnessed in English with the seats covered with a white cloth drove up;\nthe coach-man had a white livery with the blue bands and a white top-hat with a blue hatband on. The\nEnglish clothes and his broad Tatar physiognomy looked comically. Once more I thought that that person\nwho had dressed Ibrahim like this had a little tact.\n\nMoreover, this little word would slip out of me in every suitable and unsuitable moment, it\nwould always come out from some little corner of my consciousness to which I hadn’t yet managed to close\nthe door properly.\n\nTill we were saying good-bye to the ladies, till we were getting on the coach, grandfather\nkept explaining to Ibrahim where he had to take us, whom to ask to come in the hotel, so that we could get\na wonderful room with the sea view, and he himself had to stay at our disposal during the entire day in\norder to take us to Balaklava and only tomorrow, having carried out some other assignments, he could\ncome back to Gurzuf.\n\nI took a look at Lisa. She couldn’t take her eyes off I. and she was looking at him so intensely\nas though he was a fairy-tale prince and she was Cinderella. Having turned my eyes to I., I thought that he\nwas handsome like God, but also strict as God.\n\nRegardless of all our protests, the grandfather’s command to take us to Balaklava remained\nto be in force. Aunt was standing with her downcast eyes all the time and she looked even more page in\nbright sunbeams.\n\nI was feeling sincerely sorry for her, and it seemed to me that I, lonely and homeless, could\nunderstand her pain and uncertainty for her future new independent life more than others. When I was\nsaying good-bye to her, I squeezed her hand firmly and bent down to kiss it not prompted by my good\nmanners, but from the bottom of my heart, guided by a sincere impulse.\n\nIt seemed to me that she felt the warmth of my heart, she squeezed my hand and looked\ninto my eyes. I was even stupefied for a moment – such an abyss of despair had opened in her eyes.\n\n“My God,” I was thinking to myself while sitting next to I. who was talking about something\nto Lisa. “Is there really so much suffering in man’s life? Why life is created like this? Why there are so many\ntears, murders, poverty and misery? How one can understand I.’s words that man himself creates all of his\nsorrows?”\n\nThe station was rather far away from the city. I got to Crimea and this historical city for the\nfirst time. Everything was wonderful for me here. I could see only redoubts and towers, like alive Kornilov,\nNachimov, Totleben and the real hero of the terrible battles – an ordinary Russian soldier – emerged in my\nimagination.\n\nI. was talking to the coach-man who turned out to be born in Sevastopol and who had buried\nhis grandfather not a long time ago. His grandfather took part in the battles of the fourth bastion.\n\n\nHe volunteered to take us to the upper boulevard from where we could see the places of the\nbattles with the shelters and bastions, and in Balaklava we could see the port where the huge ship, the\neminent English “Black Prince” went down.\n\nMost of all I wanted to see the Nachimov’s kurgan, but I didn’t want to poke my nose into\nthe conversation. My heart was so full of the pain which I had met and experienced that my usual\ncarelessness and attention to new places moved to the distant plan, and all people’s sufferings were\nshining like the sun that was scorching us without mercy.\n\nIn truth this city has survived only thanks to such victims and such unspeakable sufferings,\nthanks to the death of thousands private soldiers whose names were never kept in history, so they are\ncalled in the general folk name – Ivan One Hundred Thousand.\n\nThe crowned emperor Nikolay emerged in my imagination, who didn’t have common sense\nto send at least sufficient supply of food and army to this place. Instead of this, he was concentrating the\ntroops in Caucasus and waiting for the enemy there. And besides him, there were so many villains and\nnoble fools who helped those thousands of Ivans to perish here like unknown heroes, to die simply and\nwithout any curses.\n\nI. interrupted these thoughts by asking me if first of all I would agree to drop in and find out\nabout the tickets to Constantinople. Now Ibrahim interfered, he was trying to persuade I. that there was an\nagent of the liners’ company in the hotel where he would take us, who would get us the tickets and arrange\nour foreign passports. In general at the moment there weren’t any problems regarding this yet, because\nthere were few passengers, but in a month there would be “a great mass” of them as the coach-man\nstated.\n\nI. agreed to go straight to the hotel, but I saw that he was worried about something. In spite\nof his entire self-control, his face was strict and gloomy.\n\nIf I hadn’t known my friend better, how unhappy I would have been by connecting my\ndestiny with such a man like he was now! As though having read my thoughts, I. turned his face to me and\nsmiled affectionately.\n\nWhat a strange instrument a man’s heart is! One of his smiles and an easy squeeze of his\nhand were fully enough for me, so that I could feel easy again, so that all those powers of joy and feelings\nwhich I had put away in the shadow of my soul would awake in my heart.\n\nI. told Ibrahim to go to the general post-office and to have the letters sent. Exactly at this\nmoment we were driving next to the historical cathedral where once a coffin was standing with the remains\nof Kornilov who was killed while being in defence. This time my imagination was drawing not only the\nsadness of his family and the entire nation, but also a perception that our nation was unbeatable while\nsuch admirals were being born in it...\n\nWe stopped by the post-office – the building was poor and ugly because of its dirtiness. I.\nsent the letters, took the telegrams and, having noticed the posters and announcements of the liners’\ncompanies stuck on the wall, he asked where we could buy the tickets to Constantinople.\n\nAn old watchman who had an old and dirty uniform on explained to him that the agent from\nseaside hotel was still waiting for the passengers to come, but in general no one wasn’t even asking about\nthe tickets yet.\n\n\nAll of us took our seats in the coach again and turned towards the hotel which was\nabsolutely close already. Ibrahim’s boss must have been well known here, because soon the manager was\ninvited, and we settled in the best room.\n\nThe liners’ agent sent by the manager entered our room in several minutes. He explained to\nus that an excellent new English ship would cast off for its maiden trip to Smirn and Constantinople\ntomorrow at three o’clock in the afternoon, and tonight an old and dirty Italian trough would also be off,\nbut the new ship would still outrun it, besides there still was a free luxurious cabin in it, in which nobody\nhad ever travelled yet.\n\nI. agreed to take the tickets to the luxurious cabin, he gave him our passports and money and\nagreed that we would be taking our dinner here at the hotel at eight o’clock in the evening, and that he\nwould bring the tickets to us, but he would be able to deliver our foreign passports only tomorrow at one\no’clock in the afternoon, because nobody was doing it here so quickly.\n\nI. took care of feeding Ibrahim, while we washed ourselves, changed our clothes and\ndescended to the cool restaurant’s hall to take our breakfast. I. told me that there was a telegram from\nAnanda. He informed us that everything was going well, that Florentian had already left to Paris, that he\nwould be sending us the news both to Sevastopol and Constantinople and that we should write him about\nour trip to Moscow, to the same hotel.\n\nHaving taken our breakfast, we took our seats in the Ibrahim’s coach and left to look around\nin the city, relying on our coach-man’s taste and knowledge.\n\nMost likely he often used to show the city to the friends of Lisa’s grandfather, because he\nchose the itinerary very skilfully by paying attention to the newest buildings and he explained to us that he\nwould be taking us back through another road, so we could get to know the whole city.\n\nThe higher avenue made a great impression on me. We went round these historical places of\nfame for a couple of times, although many were calling them the historical pages of shame.\n\nHaving been nowhere, seeing the sea for the first time in my life, I was simply melting out of\nfascination, while looking at the raging waves at the foot of Balaklava’s precipices. I forgot everything, only\nthe sea and the sun existed for me now, and it seemed to me that already nothing else could be better.\n\nI. was jeering at me, saying that soon I would see such beauty that Crimea would seem to me\nlike a miserable little corner. He was also sneering at my fascination by the sea, stating that already the first\nstorm which I would experience would change my temperamental fascination into maledictions.\n\nWe returned to the hotel only at eight o’clock. Having paid Ibrahim generously and having\ntaken the tickets from the agent, we went to our room and from there – to the restaurant to take our\ndinner.\n\nI wasn’t feeling neither tiredness nor hunger nor the scorching sun while I was out of doors.\nNow my face was burning, I wanted to eat, to drink and to sleep – everything at once. Having looked at I., I\npulled my shoulders in my thoughts. It seemed to me that this man only now left his study where he was\ncalmly reading the newspapers all day long. In truth he was beaten by the sun and the wind a little, there\nwas a little white stripe on his forehead left from his panama, but his face wasn’t burning like mine anyway,\nI couldn’t see any tiredness in him, he probably could stand up and keep travelling, while I was simply\nfainting out of fatigue.\n\nThere were little people in the hall, but several tables were occupied. I was so absorbed in\nmyself and my appetite that I wasn’t even looking round.\n\n\nI was surprised that I. wasn’t eating much. To my question if he wasn’t hungry he answered\nto me that one shouldn’t eat much while travelling: the less you eat the easier you travel and grasp the\nsurroundings.\n\nI didn’t hear any reproach or hint at me in his voice, but I felt uneasy instantly. Moreover, I\ndistinguished myself with my great appetite, I even used to amaze my friends with this in the secondary\nschool. Although I wasn’t feeling like a glutton, but now I attributed this sin to myself at once.\n\nThe food lost its taste, I pushed the plate away. Having noticed that I stopped eating, I. asked\nme why. I told him straight and clearly that my appetite was gone, because I became ashamed of my\ngluttony in comparison to him.\n\n“It seems to me that one shouldn’t compare oneself to anybody at all neither to one’s\nappetite nor to anything else in one’s life. Everybody has his own circumstances, and you cannot live\nanother person’s life not for a moment,” I. was talking to me. “My dear, eat to your health as much as you\ncan. The time will come when you are of my age and then the need for food will remain only as the\nnecessity and not as the relish. It is really my fault that I’ve spoiled your appetite with my thoughtless\nanswer,” and he gave me a tender smile.\n\n“It is so strange that you consider yourself to be much older than me. Soon I will be twenty\none and you really aren’t older than twenty six or seven, maybe even younger. And regarding my appetite, I\nthank you for those words, as well as for everything else what I’ve heard from you.”\n\nThen I kept talking in English.\n\n“What would have happened to me if you hadn’t gone with me? What would I have done?\nHow could I help my brother if you weren’t with me? I already told Florentian that I couldn’t live while\nbeing in someone’s debt, and your words that a person who was unable to make his bread couldn’t\nunderstand the meaning of life have convinced me even more that it couldn’t go on like this. Since that ill-\nfated night when I changed into fancy suit for Ali’s feast I cannot come out of my spiritual fancy ball. Now\nI’m a servant-interpreter, now a nephew, now a cousin, now a friend – the servant’s role would suit me\nmost. Let me be your servant, because I cannot be useful for you in anything else. Perhaps, in the beginning\nthat’ll be difficult for me, too, but I will try to be a good servant,” I was talking to my friend silently, trying\nto remain calm, but with a trembling heart.\n\n“My poor boy,” I. answered to me. “Let’s put off this conversation until our sea trip. Maybe\nthere, having broken away from the earth and all its conditionality, you’ll understand better the great\nresponsibility of this moment for your brother’s life, his happiness and his further destiny. I’m not going to\ndissuade you from working, only you have to understand what that your job is. Perhaps, life which opens\nand lets you see so close the grandeur and horror of man’s paths so intensely during the last days will open\nfor you the deeper meaning of your own life, too. Perhaps, your job isn’t to be my servant, perhaps you\nhave to be the servant not only of your nation, but of the entire boundless life that is ringing round us.\nWe’ll talk about this in the ship, and now eat your ice-cream, because soon it’ll thaw,” I. finished talking and\nsmiled again.\n\nHis voice was so unspeakably sincere, he was looking at me helpless, homeless, lonely and\nlost so tenderly with this black eyes that unwillingly I remembered that moment when he was dying in the\nhold of the ship, and Ananda saved him.\n\nI wasn’t lying in a death-agony, but to tell the truth those were really difficult days of my\nspiritual agony.\n\n\nWe finished eating and went upstairs to our room. Our beds were already made, we still\nadmired the dark sky, the lights of the ships in the port and went to bed.\n\nHaving woken up in the morning, I didn’t find I. in the room, but until I put myself in order he\ncame back. He was fresh and merry, he had a white linen suit and the same shoes on, and there were\nparcels in his hands. It turned out that he woke up very early and decided to take a walk in the city. He\nstumbled on a great shop where he bought two white suits for me and himself, because otherwise we\nwould fry in the ship.\n\nHe unwrapped the parcels. I tried the white suit on and I looked very ridiculous to myself,\nbut I stayed in it anyway.\n\nThen I. told me that on his way back to the hotel he met yesterday’s agent of the ships, who\nwas going with the captain of our ship. He became acquainted with the captain, and he offered us to move\nto our luxurious cabin before the whole stream of passengers, he explained exactly where the ship was\nstanding. I. treated the captain to an excellent wine at the restaurant of our hotel and received from him a\nnote to the captain’s assistant on duty that we were allowed to occupy the cabin at any moment. It was a\npity for me that we had to leave the solid ground at least an hour earlier, but my inner voice was telling me\nthat I. wouldn’t hurry without necessity, and I had no objections. When I was ready, I. examined everything\nand proposed to drink a cup of coffee, then I had to go to the same shop and buy two more suits made of\ndark pongee or similar.\n\nI was happy, because I could spend one more hour on the land and I decided that I was one\nof those amateur unfortunates who were breaking into the sea by standing on the shore. When I thought\nabout my first such long trip by sea, even a nostalgia made its appearance.\n\nSoon we arranged the rest of the affairs on shore and found the suits which I. wanted. I liked\nthe dark grey suit so much that I stayed in it. Having come back to the hotel, we settled accounts with it,\nand the agent brought us the passports sooner than we were agreed. We took the boat from the quay of\nthe hotel and rowed to the steamer.\n\nWe were circling among lots of different ships for a long time until finally we rowed up to\nsuch vast thing that was exactly our ship painted in white and red. Our boat and ourselves, we looked only\nlike small beetles in front of it.\n\nHaving climbed the deck through companion ladder and given the captain’s note to his\nassistant on duty, we went to our luxurious cabin. It was on the upper deck, next to the captain’s cabin and\nseparated from it only by a wooden partition. Such unusual neighbourhood of our cabin gave us also an\nespecial superiority in comparison to the other passengers. We had a little area of the upper deck, which\nbelonged only to us, where nobody from the passengers had the right to enter, except us. Moreover, there\nwas an excellent bath in our cabin. The walls of the cabin were upholstered with the grey silk, there were\ntwo soft coaches in it, a lamp with the lamp-shade fixed to each of the coaches and a mat lantern fitted into\nthe ceiling.\n\nAll holders which protected the belongings from tossing were made of nickel. The grey\ncarpet with reddish flowers covered the entire floor and went very well with the wall upholstery. I had\nnever seen such luxury before, so I was standing like always – with my mouth and my eyes opened wide.\n\nI. didn’t allow me to dream for a long time, he took my hand and brought me onto the deck.\nThe view to the city was very beautiful, but the bare hills surrounding it and the yellow, dry and sun-\ncracked soil wasn’t alluring my eyes.\n\n\nHaving looked at the clock, I was surprised how fast the time had flown past – it was two\no’clock already. Soon we’ll put out to sea.\n\nFinally, the sailor from the boat brought our last things into the cabin and, to my great joy,\nattached all of them. We said good-bye to the agent who was always trying to help the sailor, but in truth\nhe was only dashing here and there without any meaning and use.\n\nA thought flashed that my life of the last days was also similar to the actions of this agent. I\nwas also assisting other people in their actions, but in fact I couldn’t see neither logic nor meaning nor\nessence in my behaviour.\n\nI thanked the agent, he gave him some additional money, therefore he was pouring his\ngratitude around and, having pulled out his visiting-card, he was persuading us that it was enough to write\nhim a letter or a telegram to Sevastopol and all of his services would be guaranteed. I. took his visiting-card,\nhe told him my last name and agreed that it could happen so that we would still need his services. He asked\nhim as though by the way if a similar fast steamer wasn’t cruising to Constantinople during the next days.\n\nThe agent laughed and answered him that none of the ship companies had anything similar\nto this great ship, and that during the next two weeks only the old freight or freight-passenger ships with all\ntheir stops on the shores would be cruising, while our steamer would be cruising without any of these petty\nstops, the first one would be in Odessa, then to Constantinople at full speed.\n\nThe sailor was the last one who left us. He was a deft and cheerful chap serving our cabin\nfrom the team of ship servants who was running up and downstairs like an acrobat. He showed us the\nbuttons of all the bells, explaining their purpose, although there were English notes below each of them\nanyway.\n\nHe became even more pleasing after receiving a good tip, and he revealed one more of the\nqualities of the luxurious cabin to us – we didn’t have to go downstairs at the joint table, table d’hote,\ninstead we could ask the food to be served upstairs, in our cabin.\n\nIn several minutes, on his own initiative he brought us the breakfast, dinner and supper\nmenus. Having taken a look at them, I. told him that we were vegetarians, so if it was possible he would like\nto make arrangements about our food with the cook.\n\nThe sailor dashed downstairs and after some time he came back with two impressive persons\nwho were dressed in the suits of irreproachable whiteness. One of them was maitre d’hotel, while the\nother one was chef. The chef was stout and proud, while the maitre d’hotel was tall and thin, his attitude\nshowed the understanding of his value and politeness.\n\nWe made arrangements very quickly. The chef stated that he had a great assistant, an expert\nvegetarian, that there was a big reserve of the greens and vegetables in the stockroom, while the maitre\nd’hotel offered us himself to take our breakfast and dinner a half of hour earlier. Having received a large\nbanknote each, both of them became even more pleasing, and the chef asked us if we wanted to take our\nbreakfast already in a half of hour, while the public was still only starting to arrive, and the joint table was\nat half past three. I. agreed, both gentlemen left and finally we were left alone.\n\nI was stunned by all that noise, cries and squeak of the cranes which were lifting the loads. I\nhad never seen how a huge steamer was loaded. Moreover, I had seen a ship only from the distance, but I\nhad never been on it.\n\nHuge bundles were thrust into an open deep hold which from above seemed to be simply\nwithout any bottom. Lots of porters with the loads on their shoulders were dashing in one line through the\n\n\nlong little bridges which were stretched through several barges and which reached the shore. These two\nlines of people were moving without a break: they were running from the steamer to the shore and then\nthey were slowly coming back, stooped heavily.\n\nAll of a sudden my attention was focused on the cow that appeared in the air for a moment.\nThe frightened animal was bleating terribly and breaking out of the strong belts which were tied to the\ncrane. Soon, one after another the cows disappeared in that bottomless hole of the hold. Then the turn of\nthe horses came. They were suffering, neighing and dying to be free even more than the cows.\n\nEverything was amazing me. It seemed to me that I knew everything – I knew that the\nsteamers and the holds existed, that alive animals were loaded in them, but when I saw with my own eyes\nhow complicated everything was, it seemed to me that human mind which created all this technology was\na real miracle.\n\nI shared my thoughts with I. He gave a smile and answered me that not for the first time\nduring these days I was astonished at the miracles of human sagacity, but in truth there weren’t any\nmiracles in life. Whatever field they would belong to, if they were obvious or imaginary, felt with one’s\nthought or intuition – all of them were only one or another level of knowledge.\n\n“We should take our breakfast as soon as possible,” I. kept talking to me. “Soon they will\nfinish loading the goods and the flow of the passengers will spill. I would like to watch them with you, only I\ndon’t know if the heat doesn’t impair your health.”\n\nI answered him that I would be watching the passengers with the greatest pleasure and\nattention. To my question why he wanted to observe this crowd now, although he was always trying to\navoid any greater racket, I. answered me that he wanted to be certain if there weren’t any of our\npersecutors in the ship, that if we succeeded to cast off without them now, then we could be calm until we\nreach Constantinople, and that then Ananda’s friends would meet us there.\n\nExactly at this moment the sailor brought a collapsible table and two chairs in, then the man-\nservant with the tablecloth, napkins, plates and dishes stepped in. To the question what we were going to\ndrink, I. ordered a bottle of wine and some fanciful drink with the ice. I heard the name of that drink for the\nfirst time.\n\nSoon we were already sitting at the table, and I was enjoying it, sucking the cold reddish,\nexceptionally delicious and aromatic drink through a straw.\n\nWhile we were taking our breakfast like this, the captain came onto the deck. He greeted I.\nlike his old friend, he was very pleasing with me, too, and with his elegance he reminded me of Florentian.\nHe didn’t refuse the wine that was standing in the little silver bucket full of ice. The captain was treating us\nlike awaited guests, he kindly offered us to use the whole deck, not only that little area next to our cabin.\n\n“Soon the passengers will start boarding the steamer,” the captain was talking to us, while\nsipping the wine. “Although the season hasn’t started yet, although there’s still no real flow of the\npassengers and most of the ships are empty, but all tickets to my ship were sold out already a month ago.\nYou are so lucky, because completely by chance, on the eve of your arrival, the countess R. from Gurzuf\nrefused this cabin.”\n\nI was trying to hide my confusion, I was trying to imitate the undisturbed and calm I.’s\nappearance, so I could remain at least “a well-bred” person, but I was shaken by such a coincidence very\nmuch. Lisa’s mother must have had to cruise in this cabin, or maybe even her miserable aunt was hoping\nfor this journey.\n\n\n“If you aren’t going to do something serious,” the captain continued, “then I would advise\nyou to arm yourselves with the binoculars and observe the spectacle of the ship boarding. This is such an\nevident arena of manifestation of people’s politeness, characters, manners and self-control that it can\nbecome not only an interesting view, but also a lesson of life. There’s a stretched tent with the curtain in\nfront of my cabin, so that you wouldn’t have to sit in the heat. You can pull down the curtain, so that\nnobody would see you, and observe in the shadow how some of them are rushing about, while the others\nare saying sad or cheerful good-byes, sometimes there are those who can hardly walk. Some comic\nsituations happen, too.”\n\nSeeing that we had already finished eating, having tossed off the whole bottle of wine like a\nglass of juice, the captain offered.\n\n“This way please, I will show you myself how you can settle better. You can sit here until the\nship casts off. Only when we go to the open sea and my assistants with their reports start coming to me,\nthen – as well as every time when we cast off – I will have to meddle in other businesses myself, and it\nwouldn’t be interesting for you.”\n\nWhile talking like this, he seated us under the dark blue curtain and gave us excellent\nbinoculars.\n\n“Feel yourselves like at home. See you later. When we cast off to the sea and I come here,\nonly then you will have to leave my domain.”\n\nHe put his hand at the peak of his cap and went downstairs.\n\n“Well, everything worked out even better than you wanted,” I was talking to I.\n\nHe bowed his head, took the binoculars and started observing the public that was crowding\non shore. Seeing that he wasn’t inclined to talk, I didn’t have anything to do but to follow his example.\n\nOur steamer must have been sunk deep into the water, because the passengers were\naccepted not from the common quay, but from the side of the port. Exactly now we could see well several\nelegant carriages with the ladies dressed up in white dresses with white umbrellas and men in white suits\nand panamas.\n\nThe lines of the hired carriages kept coming from both sides, in which the most mixed public\nwas sitting, which from the distance looked like a white spot, too.\n\nThe little bridges were still vacant. The sailors on shore barred them with two partitions with\nturns. At each of the partitions an officer and two sailors were standing for the ticket control.\n\nOur binoculars were so great that we could see clearly even the faces. I was mostly\ninterested in the public that was going along the left bridge, apparently to the first and second classes. The\nflow of dark dressed people was moving from the right side. They were lugging their parcels and chests.\nBoth fezzes and bright robes were flashing. Women with their children of different ages were going in\ngroups. From their head to foot they were muffled up in black burnouses, their faces were covered with\nblack nets.\n\n“What a joy, what a success!” suddenly I heard I.’s cry.\n\nHe showed me two tall men with red fezzes. They had already climbed on the bridge and\nthey stood out in the white and elegant crowd with their dark clothes and red head covers.\n\n\nI started observing them. One of them was older, he was about forty years old. Another one\nwas absolutely young, he was of my age. Both of them were dark-haired, dark-eyed, handsome and very\nslim.\n\nI. rose and warned me not to leave this place. He explained to me that he was going to meet\nthe Turks. They were Ananda’s friends whom we were going to visit in Constantinople. We were lucky,\nbecause unexpectedly we could cruise with them in the same ship already from Sevastopol.\n\nAs soon as I. was gone, the captain came onto the deck. He was very surprised at finding me\nalone; I had to explain everything to him that I. saw his friends on the little bridge and that he went to meet\nthem.\n\n“It means that you would be travelling merrily,” the captain was speaking to me. “Tell your\nbrother that his friends will be welcome guests on this deck by transgressing the first rule that forbids the\npassengers from the first class to get up here.”\n\nI thanked him for such pleasing words, our looks met.\n\nApparently, during the last weeks I was simply lucky to meet people with exceptional eyes,\nand I was vexed by my most simple dark eyes.\n\nThe captain was young, about thirty two or three years old. His slender figure, very swift\nmovements and light step – everything was telling about his great physical strength and endurance. His\nneatly shaved face and quadratic chin were telling about his great administrative skills. His nicely outlined\nlips were tightly pressed together. His facial features weren’t so regular like the ones of Florentian or\nAnanda, but he was handsome and he must have been great success among women. His strength and\nstrong character were gushing from his entire elegant figure.\n\nOnly when I met his attentive look I thought for a while if it would be pleasing for me to be\nhis close friend. His eyes were yellowish like an amber, while his pupils were strange, oblong like the ones\nof a cat. These amber-coloured eyes which seemed to me to be even cruel didn’t vanish from my\nimagination until I. was back.\n\nI came back very joyful. I hadn’t seen him like this. He was telling me that our friends Turks\nleft Moscow after us, they met Ananda and had his letter for us, which they expected to hand us only in\nConstantinople. They will bring us the letter as soon as they have their breakfast and put their belongings in\norder.\n\nTo my question how they got the tickets to this ship, I. answered me that they ordered them\ntogether with their train tickets while they were still in Moscow and that they took them from the central\nbureau of an English sea company.\n\nIt seemed to me that he already wasn’t interested in observing the public boarding the ship\nanymore, he sat down with reluctance and he was glancing over the moving lines of people now and again.\n\nIn the meanwhile the view was striking with an extraordinary many-coloured mixture of\nclothes, all sorts of national costumes and the contrasts of the people’s behaviour. There were those who\nwere rushing about, pushing one another and shouting, so everything turned into a one continuous buzz.\nThen suddenly the hooter of the steamer was heard; and if not the sailors who were keeping back the\npressure of the whole human crowd, there would have formed the real jam.\n\n\nI was observing the moving flows of people for a long time. Finally the little bridges were\nlifted, the distance between the steamer and the shore was increasing and the captain’s command was\nheard. He was standing at the wheel himself and he was leading the ship into the open sea.\n\n\n# Chapter 11\n\n## On the ship\n\nWe were still sitting under the blue tent, and I was rejoicing at the opportunity to finally see\nthe real sea, the endless spaces of water, where the shores weren’t flashing in the distance even when\nlooking through the best binoculars.\n\nI wanted to talk about it with I., but to my great surprise, he wasn’t rejoicing with me. On the\ncontrary – he was looking at the horizon attentively and, although we were cruising through the surface of\nthe water plain like the glass, he was predicting the furious storm in the Black Sea, which was rare in this\ntime of the year. I was also looking at the horizon through the binoculars, but I couldn’t see anything except\nthe sea and the clouds merged into one grey band.\n\n“As soon as the captain shows up, we will give him the binoculars back, thank him for his\nhospitality and go to our cabin,” I. was explaining to me. “Until the sea is still calm, we have to search the\ntravelling-bag everywhere, because Ananda must have put some tablets from the tossing for you there. If,\nas I think, the hurricane falls on us, the signs of which I can see already, then you must hurry to take the\ntablet three times before the beginning of the tossing. We will have to do a lot of work in the third class\nduring the storm. The privileged public will have more conveniences, although they also will have to\nundergo a lot, but the third and fourth classes will suffer the most and they will need our help.”\n\nI fell to thinking. I. hadn’t told me a single time about the dangers of a sea trip, while for me\nthis cruising also seemed to be only a pleasant amusement.\n\nSoon we left the port and put out to open sea, but my eyes could still distinguish the bare,\nyellow and totally unlovely shores.\n\nThe captain showed up on our deck. We gave him the binoculars back, thanked him for his\nhospitality and wanted to leave already, but he looked at us vigilantly and asked us if we were sailing often\nin the sea. I. answered him that he was used to the sea, while I was sailing for the first time.\n\n“I’m afraid that your first acquaintance with the sea won’t be very pleasing for you,” the\ncaptain told me. “The barometer is showing an absolute untruth for such time of the year. If I hadn’t\nchosen it myself I could think that it was a charlatan’s work. I think that we’ll experience not a simple\nstorm, but an absolutely rare element. Although my ship is excellent, I think that tonight we’ll have to fight\na lot against the wind, the sea and the heavy shower. You must shut yourselves tightly in your cabin. I also\nwill tell my sailors to cover your cabin with the protective shields, because I think that the waves will reach\nthis deck, too.”\n\nI was terrified. I could compare the ship from our deck to the great three-storey house, so I\ndidn’t think that such waves could also exist.\n\nThe captain’s face was very resolute and cheerful, but it was austere. This man of iron will\nprobably didn’t even understand what the feeling of fear was. It seemed that he was rejoicing at joining the\nbattle against the element. I thought for a while that he probably loved the sea itself only because of that\nbattle, and if anything was still worrying him now, it was only the responsibility for the people’s lives, for\nthe ship and its freight, which were entrusted to him, and in this grey mass of water he was the full master.\n\n\nI. expressed his opinion that the storm would probably start at night, while the captain was\nsaying that he was expecting only the stormy sea and tossing at night, from which mostly the people and\nthe cattle would suffer, while the real storm should fall on us only in the morning, most likely at dawn.\n\nThe captain’s assistants with their reports started approaching him. They were waiting for his\ncommands, so we said good-bye to him and went to our cabin.\n\nI started searching the travelling-bag which Florentian gave to me. I didn’t even expect it to\nbe so capacious. There were many partitions in it, and one of them was dedicated to the travelling first-aid\nkit.\n\nI asked I. that perhaps I should swallow one of the magic Ali’s pills – they gave lots of\nstrength and they refreshed, - but I. answered me that this wouldn’t help to avoid the sea tossing and that\nwe had to find the special tablets which could calm giddiness and vomiting, because Ananda couldn’t fail to\nforesee the tossing while he was putting the things into the travelling-bag.\n\nI allowed I. himself to keep searching for them. And indeed, very soon he found the tablets\nand made me to take one of them at once.\n\n“My dear friend, you’ll have to lie in bed for a while. Now you will feel a slight dizziness and\nnausea, but the tablets will help you to withstand the tossing,” I. was talking to me, while putting the things\nback into the travelling-bag and at the same time extending the pyjamas and slippers to me.\n\nI was feeling very well, but I understood that I would have enough time to admire the sea, so\nnow it would be not bad at all to lie for a while.\n\nIt seemed that it was high time for me to lie down. As soon as I thought how wonderful my\nbed was, everything started drifting before my eyes, my temples were beating and I was sickened. I even\nuttered a groan. I.’s hand touched my forehead, he mopped the sweat that suddenly appeared on my face\nfrom somewhere. Then he bent down and tucked a soft pillow under my head carefully.\n\n“That is a very good sign, Lovushka,” I heard such his voice, as though he hadn’t been next to\nme, but somewhere far away from me. “Everything will be gone in several minutes, then you won’t feel\neven the strongest tossing. If the storm starts only at dawn, as the captain is thinking, then you will be in\ntime to temper your organism with this medicine and you will be my great assistant when we have to give\nhelp to the suffering passengers from the third and fourth classes. You told me that you wanted to work.\nWell, now the life has sent you an opportunity to become a selfless servant to the whole crowd of the\npeople who aren’t tempered and prepared for the suffering that is waiting for them tonight. If you don’t\nfeel any fear, if you don’t yield to any disgust, but you will try to render assistance and cheerfulness to the\nfrightened children and grown-ups – you will lay such firm foundation for your new life of love and activity\nthat all your subsequent tests will look unworthy of any feeling of fear to you.”\n\nI could hear his words, I understood their meaning very well, but I simply couldn’t move even\na finger.\n\nI don’t know for how long I was lying like this, but finally I felt that my temples stopped\nbeating, my nausea was gone, but the terrible state of my dizziness when everything was drifting before my\neyes left an unpleasant impression in my organism, and I was still afraid of opening my eyes, so that I\nwouldn’t feel that unpleasant faint of my heart. I was feeling better and better, finally I rose from the bed,\nlooking merrily at I., having forgotten instantly about the just experienced troubles.\n\n\n“You are the hero, Lovushka. I didn’t believe that you could get rid of everything so quickly. I\nremember how I myself was getting used to this antidote against the tossing, so I kept lying motionless for\nquite a long time,” I. was talking to me joyfully.\n\n“Yes, that didn’t last for a long time, but anyway I have to like a hero in order to take the rest\nof the tablets and to get into such an experiment for tempering my strength. God forbid that tempering if it\ncan be reached with such amount of efforts,” I answered him.\n\n“It is so strange to hear such words from the person who already started to understand the\ncomplexity of life and all of its unexpected turns which are called coincidences. It seemed to me that during\nthis time you, Lovushka, made sure of how much heroic strain from man could suddenly require the\nevening of that day when in the morning he woke up joyful and careless like a baby, and when the day was\nclosing in he became the grown-up already and the destiny invited him for such a feat about which he had\nread only in the fairy-tales.”\n\n“That is true, as well as everything what I hear from you,” I answered him while dressing\nmyself. “It may well be that I could do something more – not only swallowing such a nasty tablet, - if I could\nalways stay in the sphere of my focussed attention, but I’m so absent-minded that I’m unable to use\neverything what I could understand from you and Florentian. I cannot think about those who need me at\nonce, first of all I’m thinking about myself. Well, this time I also didn’t take into account that I might still\nexperience the storm in the ship not for a single time while I would try to distract the attention of the\npersecutors from my brother, I also didn’t take into account the help to those unfortunate people who\nwould be suffering during this storm already and who would need your care.”\n\n“Of course, I’m ready to swallow that nastiness right now,” I added after being silent for a\nwhile.\n\nI dressed myself, I. embraced me merrily, having noticed that he didn’t doubt my real\nfeelings not for a moment. He offered us ourselves to come down and visit his friends Turks from the first\nclass, to become acquainted with them and to take the letter. Moreover, he offered me to see the steamer,\nits many sitting-rooms, the reading-room, the library, the great hall and the dining-room, but I was already\nwaiting for the storm and I had lost any curiosity to all that luxury, so I agreed to see only the third and\nfourth classes where we would have to do some work at night.\n\nI. agree with my opinion and he called our sailor. He demonstrated his masterly jumps\nthrough several steps again. I. gave him the note to the Turks from the first class.\n\nThe sailor didn’t linger with an answer, because the red fezzes of the Turks soon showed\nafter him.\n\nI. met them by the stairs and asked the sailor to bring some chairs for us. In the twinkling of\nan eye, he brought us four woven arm-chairs which seemed to be very light, but in fact I was unable neither\nto lift nor even to push them.\n\n```\nI started to inspect my new acquaintances.\n```\nEven without the fezzes, their typical Turkish appearance wouldn’t have misled anybody. The\nolder Turk to whom I. presented me like a brother of his friend, thus also like his own brother, smiled to me\npleasingly. He introduced the youth to me, having said to me that he was his son, then he gave me\nAnanda’s letter. He also pronounced his name which sounded so strangely and was so long that I didn’t\neven understand it. The Turk was a handsome man, but now he looked older than he looked to me through\nbinoculars, and especially when he was next to I. who was gushing his youth and beauty.\n\n\nI noticed that both Turks were especially respectful to I. They were listening for each of his\nwords so irreproachably as I. himself and Ananda were listening to Florentian.\n\nI was very surprised by the blue eyes of the younger Turk. In the beginning both Turks looked\nlike dark-eyed to me, only when the sunbeam touched the bronze face of the youth, I made sure that they\nlooked so only because of his long black eyelashes and his big pupils, but when his pupils contracted in the\nsunlight, I could see his blue, attentive and kind eyes.\n\nI was so impatient, because I wanted to read the letter. I even was feeling how my cheeks\nwere turning red, but the rules of courtesy didn’t allow me to do that, so I sighed and put it into my pocket.\n\nThe conversation about the upcoming storm started, and the older Turk told I. that in spite\nof the strict captain’s instructions to keep silence, the rumours about the possible storm had already\npartially reached the first class, and everybody as worried there, especially the ladies. The younger Turk\nadded that the posters were stuck in all halls and corridors of the steamer, which prohibited to go out to\nthe deck after ten o’clock in the evening, everybody had to be in his own place or cabin, because all exits to\nthe deck from all classes would be shut down in order to be protected from the tossing.\n\nI. shared his thoughts about serving the lower classes of the steamer during the storm. The\nTurks assured us that they would certainly join us, but we needed to get the captain’s permission for this,\nbecause he was about to shut ourselves down tightly and even to put round the protective shields.\n\nThe older Turk volunteered to find the captain and to get his permission, but I. himself\nwanted to go with him, so I was left face to face with the youth.\n\nWhile I was thinking about what I should talk to him, he let it out that he was very tired\nbecause of the examinations, that he was studying the science of nature in university of Petersburg and\nthat he entered the third course. I was very surprised and I confessed that I was the student of the second\ncourse in the same university, but I was a mathematician, and that I was amazed at my absent-mindedness,\nbecause I didn’t see him there up to now. He explained to me that he saw me several times and that\neverybody knew my reputation very well – not only as the one of the mathematician, but also as the one of\nthe great writer.\n\nI was embarrassed, I blushed and I was begging him not to mention my literary tries, because\nI had given them to read only to the closest friends of mine and I didn’t understand how everybody knew\nabout it.\n\nAccording to the words of the Turk, it happened very simply. During the charity party\norganized to help one sick friend, somebody from the students read my short story. The public liked the\nstory so much that they were asking to announce the surname of the author. They were inviting me for a\nlong time. They didn’t believe that I wasn’t in the hall and they calmed down only when my friends told\nthem that I had left for Asia. Then they decided to send that story to one of the magazines and to surprise\nme by doing so when I came back to Petersburg.\n\nI don’t know what prevailed within me now: an author’s pride or a resentment how the\npeople could do that without my permission.\n\nWe were interrupted by the voices that could be heard, and both of our friends and the\ncaptain showed up on the stairs.\n\n“I cannot forbid you to help the poor persons who will experience the worst if the storm\nreally falls on us,” the captain was explaining to them in his metal voice, “but why these children should get\nthere?” he continued by pointing at both of us. “Let them sleep or sit in their cabins. They will still have\n\n\nenough time to see the storms in their lives, and if they can be protected from at least one of them – then\nthank God.”\n\n“If the storm rages, these children will become the merciful brothers, because it isn’t easy to\npour a drink of rum in the mouth of a stiff person or to thrust a tablet between his teeth when the tossing\nis turning over the ship on its side. Our children are tempered and they won’t be afraid of the storm.”\n\nThe captain shrugged his shoulders and noticed that he wasn’t responsible if anyone of us\nwas washed away by the wave, that we didn’t understand what dangers were lurking during the storm\neven for the experienced sailors, not only for the boys who hadn’t seen anything, that once again he was\noffering us to stay in the cabins.\n\nI. was pursuing his aim. I was already thinking that there would be an argument, but once\nagain, to my great astonishment, the captain looked at I. attentively, lift his hand at the peak of his cap and,\nhaving laughed, told him.\n\n“So, tonight you want to be the captain in the fourth class. I agree to entrust it to you. You\nwill become the hospital attendants there. But I cannot give you a single sailor to help you, unless that red-\nhaired who is serving your cabin. He is strong, only a little silly, but he is very kind-hearted, and his strength\nwill come in handy to you.”\n\nOn the word, he pressed the button of the telephone and ordered someone to bring four\npairs of rubber boots and four mackintoshes with the hoods. Our sailor also showed up on the deck after\nhis call. The captain gave him a special instruction to be on duty on the deck at our cabin during the entire\nnight, and if we were going somewhere – to be next to us. That was mostly important regarding me – he\ncouldn’t retreat a step from me; since it was the first time for me to cruise in the sea, the great sailor had to\nunderstand what the captain’s instruction meant not to retreat from an unexperienced person.\n\nI was stunned because of such a nurse, perhaps I even took offence a little, but the captain\nlooked at me merrily and explained to me that this servant would come in handy to me while I would be\ntending the patients, and that I would thank him for that, even I myself would want to treat him to some\nwine if the battle against the element would end happily.\n\nIn the meanwhile, he ordered the sailor to start his duty from nine o’clock, and at the\nmoment he had to eat and to have a sleep.\n\nThey brought us the mackintoshes and the boots which didn’t seem to be made of rubber at\nall, but when I put them on I felt how elastic and warm they were. The mackintoshes suited well the others,\nonly I was drowned to my heels in mine, while the Turk had to change his boots three times till they fitted\nthem to his big and wide feet. They also changed the mackintosh for me.\n\nHaving chosen our clothes, we said good-bye to the captain and the Turks. We arranged that\nthey would come to us at nine o’clock, and if there really was the storm, we would share the medicine and\nthe responsibilities.\n\nThe captain visited us one more time and tried to convince I. once again to leave at least me\nalone in the cabin, but neither I. nor I didn’t agree with that. Then the captain invited us to go downstairs to\nthe fourth class and to get to know the place of our future work. We accepted this proposal with pleasure.\n\nThe sailor who was on duty at the end of the stairs received the strict captain’s command to\nnot allow anybody, even the senior assistant, to come to the upper part except us.\n\n\nWe were following the captain, but he asked us to walk next to him. Two more officers to\nwhom he introduced us and a couple of sailors joined us. In this way a considerable group was formed. The\ncaptain ordered to find the chief medical officer of the ship and to give him an urgent command to join us.\n\nI was surprised not only by the number of the people in the steamer, but also by the length\nof the corridors, the height of all rooms and the luxury that was prevailing everywhere. Everything was\nburied in flowers. The public from the first class was sitting in the deep arm-chairs and deckchairs which\nwere placed in the shadow of the deck. The life here was wonderful and splendid, the aroma of perfume\nand cigars was hovering in the air...\n\nFinally, we went downstairs to the third class. I was expecting to see the same dirtiness as in\nthe trains of this class, which I experienced while going from Asia to Russia, but I understood at once that I\nwas highly wrong.\n\nIt was very clean here. The truth is, only the wood could be seen around everywhere, and\nour feet weren’t buried in the carpets like in the first class, but the floor was covered with the linoleum of\nthe beautiful pattern with the vivid flowers. The tickets must have cost rather expensive here, too, because\nthere weren’t any poor persons here. The student caps struck the eye, the whole families were travelling,\nwhich according to their clothes didn’t feel a shortage of anything. The hall of the dining-room was\nbeautiful with the wooden swivel chairs. It was abundantly lit by the electricity. The joint sitting-room was\nalso here, as well as the reading-room and the smoking room. The sitting-room wasn’t separated by the\ncorridor as above, so it looked especially long.\n\nWe came down even more and got very close to the water. The fore-deck of the steamer was\nassigned to the fourth class, its ceiling was made from the rooms of the third class. There wasn’t a separate\ndeck in the third class, only the sidelong, rather wide passageways to the cabins which were arranged along\nthe entire length of the steamer.\n\nThere weren’t any cabins in the fourth class at all. The travellers here were the real poor\npersons – most of them were the families of the workers who were resettling, the wandering musicians,\nthe whole groups of unfortunate farce conjurers and comedians. The real Gipsy tribe was located in the\nseparate corner. All sorts of dialects and talks were spreading from all sides. The traders were also here,\nwho were carrying their goods and therefore, apparently, they wanted to stay closer to the hold. The\nstablemen were also here, who were accompanying their horses – in short, I was dazzled, I opened my eyes\nwidely and forgot everything else.\n\n“Keep up with me,” I heard the commanding voice of the captain and at the same moment I\nfelt that I. took my arm, having whispered that I should try to remember the allotment of the steamer\ninstead of admiring the views.\n\nI gave a sigh. There were so many possibilities to observe here, but I had to go by and to\nthink only about the storm, when it was still not clear at all if it was going to be at all, because the sun was\nshining, we were cruising through the surface of the water, which was as even as the mirror, and the only\nwaves were only those which our gigantic steamer was raising.\n\nOur group suddenly stopped. A young, totally exhausted woman who was holding a\nwonderful two years old boy on her knees, as blond as herself, was sitting in the most uncomfortable place,\nin the very spike of the ship, among the boxes and barrels. Even now the wind could blow her through\nalready. A pale, about five years old girl who seemed to be sick was lying next to her mother with her head\nput on her knees. It seemed that she might be unconscious.\n\n\n“Why you’ve chosen such uncomfortable place?” the captain asked her, addressing the\nwoman whose beautiful face was distorted with terror and her eyes were flooded with the tears.\n\n```\n“Oh, only don’t throw us out,” she was begging in French.\n```\nIt seemed that she didn’t understand English and was frightened by the commanding and\nmetal voice of the captain. She was looking at him simply pleadingly. He turned towards us, asking if\nsomebody from us could speak this language better then him, because his French pronunciation was poor.\n\n```\nI. pushed me forward, I bowed to the woman and interpreted the captain’s question.\n```\nHer tears came pouring like the peas together with her answer; she was explaining that that\nwas the only place where the brutal fellow-travellers stopped pushing and persecuting her. A\ncompassionate sailor seated them here and even threatened those two Turks who were nagging at her and\nwho didn’t leave her in peace.\n\n“My girl isn’t sick, we are just hungry. Don’t throw us out. We are going to my uncle in\nConstantinople. My husband died. A mechanism pressed him at work, but the French company didn’t agree\nto pay us anything without the court of law, but I couldn’t wait for the trial, we would have starved to\ndeath. I sold out everything, and somehow we reached Sevastopol. I bought the tickets for my last money. I\ndon’t know how we’ll reach Constantinople, but I do have the ticket,” the unfortunate woman was\nspeaking to us. She was totally lost and she was extending her ticket to the captain with horror.\n\nIt seemed that the hardship had befallen on her absolutely unexpectedly, like a bolt from the\nblue. Her clothes looked still like new, they were only dusty and stained; her children’s clothes were also\nnew, but already dirty during the journey. The small legs were stuck out of the little skirt of the little girl.\nShe had little lacquer shoes on, which didn’t suit at all for such a distant journey.\n\nEntreaty and fear, terror for her children whom she kept pressing to herself, feebleness,\ndisappointment – so many different feelings were reflected in the eyes of this creature that, with a heavy\nheart, not even thinking what I was doing, I stooped and took the girl in my arms.\n\n```\n“We cannot leave her here,” I told I. “Let’s give our cabin to her.”\n```\n“That won’t be of great use,” the captain answered me. “She and her children need the\nmedical aid. There are paid wards in the hospital of the first class in the steamer. If you can afford to pay for\nher journey in such a cabin, then you would give her a possibility to rest, to summon up her strength and to\nleave the steamer healthy already. She’s going to faint away soon, isn’t she?”\n\nHe hadn’t finished his talking yet, while the doctor was already dashing to help the woman\nwho was bending to one side. The captain blew his whistle two times, which was hanging on his chest, and\na strong sailor simply shot up in front of us.\n\n```\n“First of all, disperse everybody who has gathered round us,” the captain commanded him.\n```\nAs if after waving with a magic wand, all passengers who had crowded round us sat down in\ntheir own places, not waiting for the second command of the sailor.\n\n```\n“Now get the stretcher!” the captain commanded again.\n```\nUntil the stretcher was brought, I. asked the captain where and whom he had to pay for the\nseparate ward of the hospital for this unfortunate woman. The captain wrote a note, gave it to the doctor\nand ordered to hospitalize the mother and her children in the best ward of the hospital – the cabin No. 1A.\n\n\nHe offered to pay the money to the cashier of the ship in the first class. Young Turk volunteered to do it on\nthe spot.\n\nTwo employees of the hospital brought the stretcher, and a trained nurse came with them.\nThe woman was still unconscious. They laid her on the stretcher. The sailor stretched out his hands and\nwanted to take the girl from me, but she threw her arms round my neck firmly and burst into tears loudly. I\npressed her to myself and told I. that I would bring her myself and stay there till her sick mother recovers,\nbut I. shook his head in disagreement and explained to me.\n\n“Bring the child and instantly give the drops from this little bottle to her mother. Then come\nback to me as soon as possible. We still have a lot to do, but we won’t forget this unfortunate woman.\nLeave a note to her, explain how she can find us and promise her that we would drop in at her soon. Give\nher the drops to drink in such a way that nobody could see it,” he still managed to whisper me, and I\nfollowed the stretcher.\n\nWe were walking for a long time, I guess for no less than twenty minutes. We were climbing\nthe stairs, twisting through the corridors and we were doing so only through auxiliary rooms.\n\nThere was everything in that sailing house! There were laundries, drying rooms, stockrooms,\nthe swimming pool, many kitchens and the ice-house – I was simply lost and I wouldn’t have found my way\nback in any way.\n\nThat cabin which we finally reached was all white, it had three beds: two beds were below\nand one was above. Everything here smelt of luxury and cleanness. While the nurse was gone to get a\ndressing-gown for the patient, and the doctor had hurried to the pharmacy, I quickly poured some I.’s drops\ninto the small cup with the water and put it to the patient’s lips. She opened her eyes, took her medicine\nand put her head on the pillow again.\n\nI noticed at once that the blood had already come back to her cheeks, she moved, sighed,\nand when the doctor was back, she already rose and asked with a firm voice.\n\n```\n“Where am I?”\n```\nI gave her the girl and explained to her that she was in the hospital of the steamer where she\nwould continue her journey. In the name of the captain, I asked her not to worry about anything and added\nthat I and my brother would still call on her.\n\nI told her how to find us if she needed to, I interpreted the doctor’s request for her to go to\nthe bedroom with her children and to change into the hospital’s clothes, because such an order was valid\nhere.\n\nHaving said good-bye to her, I thought for a while that I was helpless to find my way back,\nbut at the end of the hospital’s section I saw that tall clumsy sailor who was accompanying us with the\nstretcher and now he was waiting for me.\n\nThis time we reached the fourth class quickly, because this tall clumsy sailor was running up\nand down the stairs not worse than that red-haired sailor who was introduced to us at our cabin.\n\nI found the captain and the whole group working seriously. The entire mixed crowd was\ndivided into men and women. The women and the children were placed in the middle of the deck, because\nthe sides of the steamer formed good walls here, in addition the sailors separated the very spike with the\nmetal sticks, so that the draughts wouldn’t blow.\n\n\nThe men, especially the Gipsies, raised a protest against the captain’s command to place the\nwomen separately. Then the captain gave a whistle in a certain way, and soon four armed sailors appeared\nsuddenly. The captain ordered them to be on duty here by changing every two hours.\n\nAbout ten other sailors received the instructions to fasten the freight and even the\npassengers firmly, and one of the officers was left to observe this job.\n\nWe went down to the hold which also had several floors. The lower floors were loaded to the\ntop with the boxes and parcels, while the cattle was standing on the upper floors. The captain ordered to\nhobble all cattle and the horses. I noticed that all pens were hewed with the thick, straw mats.\n\nHaving ordered and instructed lots of more, the captain went up to the fourth class again,\nwhile all of us were following him.\n\nHere he addressed the men in a language which we were interpreting into other languages;\nthe Turks had most of work to do, because they knew many Eastern and Balkan dialects. The captain\nexplained to them that everyone who would be caught drinking hard or dicing tonight, would be instantly\nsent into the solitary where he would spend at least twenty-four hours, getting only the water and bread.\nHe addressed those who were carrying vodka with them and ordered them to give it to him instantly. It\nseemed that no one wanted to get into the solitary, so without any protests the men were bringing the\nbottles of vodka and even the wattle, big, glass balloons from all sides, and if anyone was still lingering,\nthen expressive looks of the neighbours were affecting them so that their hands were extending their\nhidden bottles reluctantly.\n\nNow one shouldn’t have feared anymore that anybody would succeed to hide even his flask.\nEspecially the Gipsies were showing their worth. Having taken offence and being separated from their\nwomen, having given their vodka out of fear, they gave vent to their anger on the passengers; not a single\nbottle was left hidden from their vigilant eyes.\n\nSoon the big basket was filled to the top with the bottles, and the sailors took it out. The\ncaptain explained to them that everyone had the right to put his money for safekeeping in the cash of the\nship, independent of its sum’s size, and to get it back whenever he needed, that if there were those who\nwanted to do that, he could send the cashier to the third class, and in addition they could also put their\ndocuments for safekeeping.\n\nSeveral voices expressed such a wish, because apparently they expected to dice during their\ndrinking-bout. In this way we finished our examination. We said good-bye to the fourth class and turned to\nthe stairs. Having climbed up to the first class, we separated from the captain who still had a lot of business\nto do and from the Turks with whom we agreed to meet at our cabin at ten o’clock. We came back to our\ncabin.\n\nNot waiting for anything, I. gave to me the nasty tablet to drink. This time I wasn’t dizzy, but\nnausea, beating in my temples and shivering of my whole body was even stronger than for the first time. I\nwas sitting in the bed, and it seemed to me that something was going to explode in my head or back. Not\nonly my face, but my whole body broke into a sweat, I couldn’t move. I could hear some talking, but I\ncouldn’t understand neither who was talking nor what they were talking about.\n\nI don’t remember again for how long I was lying like this, but suddenly I started feeling an\neasiness, my body became lithe as though I would have slept for several hours. It seemed to me that only\ntwenty minutes had passed. I. told me that our dinner was coming and that we had to hurry, because I still\nhad to take the third tablet. I answered him merrily that already now I wanted to move the mountains, so\nwhat was waiting for me after the third tablet?\n\n\nWe really had to hurry with our dinner, but Florentian’s letter was already lying in my pocket\nfor so many hours that it was simply burning me, and I declared to I. that first of all I wanted to read it.\n\nHe agreed with my impatient desire and went onto the deck where our dinner table was\nalready served. The sun was hanging low, hence it could be around seven o’clock.\n\nI pulled out the letter and forgot everything around me, because the words of my wonderful\nfriend were full of love and tender, they moved me very much.\n\nFlorentian was writing to me that he was following my every step in his thoughts and that\nalthough we were separated by the physical distance, we were always firmly connected with his friendship\nand love, in the loyalty of which I had a chance to be convinced several times during these days. He kept\nwriting that this time he would keep the letter short, because there was very little time left before his\ntrain’s departure. He was asking me to be very attentive during our sea trip and to stay close to I., as I used\nto stay close to him before, because our enemies managed to find our tracks.\n\nWishing me absolute peace, he was writing to me that I should avoid any disappointment in\nevery step of my own destiny and that I should see only one goal everywhere – my brother’s life, and that I\nshould be as loyal to him as he, Florentian, was loyal to me with his friendship and assistance.\n\nI wanted to read this great letter one more time, but I. took me for the dinner, saying that it\nwas late already. We ate quickly. I. wasn’t eating much and he couldn’t take his eyes off the coming sunset.\nHe offered me to leave the letter in the cabin, not in my pocket. Then he made me to lie down and told me\nthat in half an hour he would give me the third tablet.\n\nI fell into a doze. I woke up somehow automatically from I.’s voice. I swallowed the medicine\nalmost not noticing it and I fell asleep instantly again, not feeling how the tablet was affecting me this time.\n\nI woke up from the blow as it seemed to me, but in fact that was only I. who slammed the\ndoor while entering. I got up from the bed and was surprised by looking at I., because he was standing with\nthe rubber boots and the mackintosh on already.\n\n“Dress quickly, Lovushka. The captain informed me that the storm would start and rage\nbefore the dawn. The tossing is so strong already that majority of the people in the steamer are already\nlying with sickness. We must come down to the fourth class, the assistance is already needed there.”\n\nI pulled on the boots and the mackintosh, while I. took two trip first-aid kits in leather cases\nwith strong straps; he flung one of them, the smaller one, over his shoulder himself and gave the bigger\none to me.\n\n“You will have the reserve medicine. Be sure to take Ali’s pills and also these which were in\nyour travelling-bag. Florentian is sending them to you.”\n\n```\nHe gave me the box made of the green enamel, which had the white peacock on its lid.\n```\n“Memorize how everything is placed in the first-aid kits,” he unfastened the stout case,\nopened the cover, and I saw three rows of bottles and several clear rubber drips with the marks: two drops,\nfive, ten...\n\nI was amazed at such clarity of the rubber, but I had no time to reflect on it. I also had no\ntime to admire the green box with the peacock. I put both boxes into the first-aid kit quickly and fastened\nits cover. I was feeling excellent physically, but it seemed to me that I was swinging. I. offered me to move\nmy legs apart wider, because the tossing could already be felt.\n\n\nWe came out of our brightly lit cabin, and I was surprised how the weather had changed. It\nwas raining, the wind was howling, the indiscernible darkness was around us. The dark shadow appeared\nnext to me, it turned out that that was that tall clumsy sailor. He as though stuck to me. I felt that I. took\nmy arm, and we went towards the only light spot – the stairs downwards.\n\n```\nNot having exchanged a single word, we started climbing downstairs.\n```\n\n# Chapter 12\n\n## The storm in the sea\n\nI hadn’t come down even five steps, when somebody gave a strong push on my back, and I\nwould have fallen with my head down off the steep stairs if my clumsy sailor hadn’t caught me with his\nhands, like children were usually catching the ball. He appeared on the landing in a flash and stood me on\nmy feet.\n\nI couldn’t understand in any way what had happened, but I saw that I. was holding the\nyounger Turk by his shoulders, while his father was trying to release the youth’s leg from the crack between\nthe wall and the handrail. While he was trying to move his legs apart wider, somehow he stepped into the\ncrack and, having stumbled on the handrail, he fell down and pushed my back with his head, hence I flew\ndown.\n\nIt didn’t suit to the importance of the moment very much, but it was so funny, the younger\nTurk seemed so unhappy and ashamed, that I, having forgotten about all the “tact” of the world, burst out\nlaughing. Apparently, the clumsy sailor didn’t dare to laugh loudly, so he was only snickering and choking,\nwhich made me laugh even more.\n\n“Hello,” I could hear behind my back. “Where did such a brave spirit come from in the\nsteamer, who can meet this terrible tossing with his joyful laughter?”\n\nI recognized the captain’s voice and I saw him below, on another landing of the stairs. He\nwas wearing a wet mackintosh.\n\n“So you, youth, are this hero? I can be calm that you will become a great sailor,” he added\nand blinked at me.\n\nWe were coming down. I offered the younger Turk to go first, but he looked at me so\npleadingly that I kept following the clumsy sailor. I was still laughing and soon I caught up with the captain.\n\n“I’m not a hero, but this fine fellow is,” I explained to the captain by showing our sailor to\nhim. “If not him, now you would have to send me to the hospital.”\n\n“Well, if you had to get there, then I would try to place you next to the strange beauty. The\nlittle girl liked you very much, so probably her mother would follow her example, too.”\n\nI could see his smile, but only his lips were smiling, while his eyes remained attentive and\naustere. Somehow I could feel with my entire body how great the danger was.\n\nAll of a sudden, we were rocked so much that the younger Turk almost fell down again. The\ncaptain looked at his father and told him that on the lower deck he should hold his son by his hand and that\nhe would call a sailor who would help them to climb downstairs. The captain gave a whistle and the sailor\ncame running. Having received the captain’s order, he put his arms round the younger Turk’s waist. It was\nreally difficult to come downstairs, but to my great astonishment and to even greater joy of my nurse –\nclumsy sailor, I was walking with a more and more sure step, while the Turk still had difficulties; but as soon\nas the youth felt that there were no more steps, his step became more sure at once, only he kept limping.\n\nDownstairs we stopped to discuss our actions among ourselves. The real hell was already\nhere! The wind was wailing and whistling, it was ruffling gigantic waves. The people were moaning, the\n\n\nwomen and the children were panic-stricken and crying. In the holds the horses were neighing and beating,\nthe cows were mooing and the sheep were bleating – one was unable to separate anything, everything had\nblended into a continuous wail, buzz and roar.\n\nI. gave a tug at my hand, and we went to the women’s section. Having seen us, the whole\ncrowd of them dashed at us, but most of them rolled back, because at that moment the steamer dived up\nand then down again as though to an abyss. I. was coming to more sickly and suffering of them in rotation; I\nwas pulling the medicine, which he was indicating to me. With the help of the sailors, he would lift the\nheads of the sick a little, and I would pour the medicine into their mouths.\n\n```\nThere was such a stench that if not the wind, I couldn’t have endured here.\n```\nLittle by little we made the round of everybody, and the people started calming down or\neven falling asleep. Two sailors were washing the floor with the hot water, brooms and floor-cloths.\n\nWe left the women’s section and went to help the Turks who had done only a half of their\nwork, because there were more men who needed help; several of absolutely sound people volunteered to\nhelp us. Soon the moaning and curses fell silent here, too, and everybody started falling asleep.\n\nI. gave several tufts of some dry grass to the stablemen and told them to tie them in several\nplaces in the hold. He explained to them that the grass would affect the horses in the same way as the\nmedicine did to the people, and they would fall asleep.\n\nThe Turks stayed on the deck, while we and the stablemen came down to the hold where I.\nhimself showed them in which places they had to tie the packets of the grass.\n\nHaving come back onto the deck, I. offered the sound people to take our medicine, too. He\ntold them that several hours of sleeping would strengthen them and then they could help him more when\nthe storm started.\n\n```\n“The storm? So isn’t this the storm yet?” the screams were heard.\n```\n“No, this isn’t the storm yet, but only an easy tossing,” suddenly we heard the voice of the\ncaptain near us. “So take the medicine and have a sleep if you are really brave men. Every strong hand and\nbrave heart will be needed when the storm starts.”\n\nAn unexpected appearance of the captain and his firm, sonorous voice affected the bold\nspirits who were helping us. They became silent, opened their mouths and swallowed our miraculous\ndrops.\n\nThe captain asked I. for how long the effect of this medicine was going to last, and I.\nanswered him that the people were going to calm for at least six hours. The captain pulled out his watch,\npressed the watch-spring – and twelve loud strokes echoed.\n\n“The storm will start in a couple or three hours at the latest. I decided to send a part of the\npassengers from the third class to the sitting-rooms of the second class and to place the whole fourth class\nin the third one,” the captain was explaining to us. “The move upstairs will end soon. We’ll have to\ndistribute the women, children and weaker men among free cabins of the third class by laying straw\nmattresses on the floor. I’ll send a part of my team here. I’ll ask you not to leave until everybody would be\nmoved upward. Somebody might need your help.”\n\nAnd he disappeared as suddenly as he had appeared. Now he was everywhere: he would\nclimb on to the captain’s bridge to his chief assistant, he would have time to dart a glance at every little\n\n\ncorner of the steamer, he would give instructions everywhere, he would cheer up and calm everybody and\nhe would have a good word prepared for everybody.\n\nSoon several sailors and an officer came to us. They woke up the women and offered them\nwith their children to move to the cabins of the third class. There were screams and hysteria, too, but soon\nthey moved, and there were still several free cabins left for the sickly and weak men.\n\nThe children started crying in the cabins of the women again. We had to give them the\nmedicine again, but now I. was watching every face attentively, he was listening for their breathing and\nonly then when they really needed he would tell me to pour some drops. I. would stop by some older\nworkers for a longer, he would give them some sweets, too, by thrusting them right behind the cheeks of\nthose who were drowsing.\n\nWe passed to the sitting-rooms of the second class to visit the passengers from the third\nclass, who had moved there. Here everybody needed our medicine, too, because there was the same panic,\nthe children were crying, even the men were moaning. Soon I.’s help calmed everybody down. We wanted\nto stay on duty here, but the messenger of the captain came hurriedly and asked I. to come to the first class\nto help some dying girl.\n\nWe left the Turks downstairs and hurried after the sailor to the first class. We were met by\nthe screams from all sides, the stewardesses and man-servants were running about, and I’m afraid that the\nview of human suffering was more repulsive here, because the disgusting cries in which a demand, an\nanger and egoism could be heard, used to grow into the curses and bad behaviour with the ship’s team that\nwas already run off their legs.\n\nWe were taken to the cabin in which a mother with long, loose and tousled hair was on her\nknees at the bed-head of her daughter who seemed to be fainted away. The mother herself didn’t perceive\nanything anymore. She was sobbing and shouting some Italian words off and on, she was tousling her hair\nand wringing her hands. I. with the help of the sailor lifted her off the floor, he put her to bed and told me\nto count off five drops from the indicated bottle, while he himself bent over the girl who couldn’t be\nbrought to her senses by the ship’s doctor for more than an hour already.\n\nAs soon as I gave the mother the medicine to drink, she fell asleep instantly, and I went up to\nI.\n\n```\n“A difficult case, Lovushka,” he told me.\n```\nAt this moment the steamer began to swing so much that I hardly had time to seize the wall\nsupporter, while I. with one hand was holding the girl who was rolling from the bed, with another one he\nleant against the clumsy sailor.\n\n“We must bring her to her senses immediately, then we have to drop in at the hospital and\nto hurry to help the captain,” I. was talking to me. “Lift the girl and hold her in sitting position,” he\naddressed the sailor, “and you, Lovushka, pour five drops from this dark bottle straight into her mouth.\nWait until I open her mouth. Get the medicine ready, so that you could drip it quickly.”\n\nI. pulled some strong smelling drops out of his first-aid kit and dripped one drop into each of\nher nostrils. The girl sneezed strongly in a minute. I. opened her mouth deftly, while I gave her my drops to\ndrink. The sailor had to lean against the bed with his feet and to hold me by my waist, otherwise I would\nhave fallen down on my back from the new blow onto the side, and the girl would have rolled down on the\nfloor.\n\n```\n“Now everything’s all right here, let’s hurry to the hospital,” I. whispered to me.\n```\n\nWe passed the patients to the doctor who returned. He was very surprised that the girl was\nsleeping and breathing calmly, equally, but I. was hurrying and he didn’t even heard the doctor’s words.\n\nSoon we reached the hospital through the shortest way and some winding stairs. The\nmoaning and sobbing could be heard here, too. Not paying any attention to them, we rushed into the ward\nNo. 1A. Here the poor mother didn’t know how to calm her crying children. She was about to break into\ntears herself in this hell raging round her. Every bolt of the steamer was squeaking and screeching in its\nown voice, the whole ship was shaking and trembling as if it had been made of the sheet of the thin iron,\nwhile at times the passengers would feel themselves to be head over heels, or they would rock from one\nside to another, moaning and their screams mixed with the wail of the wind seemed to be like the howls of\nthe devil.\n\nWe gave them the medicine to drink in a flash. I. gave a pill to the mother, too. He asked her\nto be brisk, saying that everything would be all right, that we had to send the energy of vivacity to the\ncaptain, that we had to strengthen his power in his fight against the element instead of crying and grieving\nwhat was only draining any energy. The mother was looking at I. so pleadingly that he squeezed her hand\nslightly and told her.\n\n```\n“Be strong. A mother must be an example to her children. Lie down next to them and sleep.”\n```\nAgain through the shortest way we were scooting onto the deck to the captain on the bridge.\nI have to admit that I. was holding my arm, while the sailor was simply pushing me from behind, and only in\nthis way I was able to jolt through all those stairs and passageways. If I hadn’t had this double assistance, I\nwould have fallen down at breakneck speed tens of times, and probably been killed to death. When we\nwent onto the deck, we got into the real hell. The lightning was flashing and it was thundering. The thunder\nwas blending with the wail and howling of the wind and reminded me of a cannonade. The lightning\ndazzled us instantly, we had to stop, because it was difficult even to breath in this freezing atmosphere of\nthe storm.\n\nWe reached the captain’s bridge with great difficulty. I didn’t even notice how the cold water\nflooded me from my head to foot, I even had to close my eyes. I was shaking myself like a dog, I was\nrubbing my eyes with my hands and I could hardly open them, but anyway I couldn’t see anything in the\ndark and on the deck which was being flashed by the lightning.\n\nI felt that I was dragged by the strong hands and I was going, if one could call those\nmovements of my body and legs “a going”: now I was lifting my leg and wanted to put it on the deck, but I\nfell on my “nurse”, and my leg would hang in the air; now I would fall back and hear I.’s voice: “Duck”, I\nwouldn’t be in time for ducking, so I would fall on my side again. Those several tens of steps which\nseparated us from the captain’s bridge seemed to me as long as the road to an unreachable happiness.\n\nBut suddenly, I heard how the clumsy sailor screamed something and yanked me forward; in\nhis turn, I. with all his strength was dragging my body which could hardly keep its balance – and in an\ninstant we got to the wheel, next to the captain and his assistants. One more moment – and we were\nflooded by the water. It pressed us to the walls of the wheelhouse, but we survived, because this gigantic\nwave didn’t have time to wash us away.\n\nI cannot even describe what happened next: the wall of the water fell on the steamer so\nmuch, it hit the wheelhouse so strongly that it trembled, while I. and the sailor dashed to the wheel,\nbecause the captain with his assistants were unable to hold it.\n\n“Lovushka,” I. was screaming, “quickly pull a pill for everybody out of the green Florentian’s\nbox, first of all – for the captain!”\n\n\nI was squeezed into the corner by the strong wind that was blowing into my legs and I was\nfeeling very steady. That helped me to find the box easily, but I understood very well that if the wave was\ngoing to hit again, I wouldn’t keep my feet. I summoned up my strength, Florentian’s figure flashed in my\nthoughts, because I was always thinking about him, my heart started beating joyfully, and my friend was so\nclose to me at this moment that I even saw him next to me. Of course, if I was lying, I would think that I was\ndreaming, but now I was certain that I saw him not in my dream – my dear guardian Florentian dressed in\nwhite had emerged in my imagination so clearly.\n\nI felt such fresh surge of strength, as though that charming friend of mine had really been\nnext to me. I pulled the pills out of my first-aid kit easily, I became merry and laughing, I leant towards the\ncaptain. He even opened his mouth out of amazement, seeing my laughing face in the moment of the\ndeadly danger. I took advantage of this immediately and thrust the pill into his mouth.\n\nThe wonderful hand of Florentian was as though holding me – I didn’t feel the blows of the\nwaves to the side or the trembling of the ship, I forgot about the death brought by every gust of the wind –\nI was giving out the pills to everybody and I swallowed the last one myself. My eyes got used to it, it\nbecame as though brighter around, but one was still unable to discern where the sky and where the water\nwas.\n\nNow all men were holding the wheel with their hands. It still seemed to me that I saw the tall\nand white figure of Florentian who now was next to I. As though he had put his hand on I.’s hands, and that\neverybody, including the captain, was obeying to I.’s commands. We were sailing like this, or to be precise\nwe were going up and down, for quite a long time. Everybody kept silent and was fighting against the\nmenacing death.\n\n“One more such heeling over of the ship, and the steamer will fall on its side, so that it would\nnever rise again,” the captain gave a shout.\n\nI don’t know what happened to me, perhaps the swallowed pill encouraged me, but I cried\ninto the very ear of the captain.\n\n```\n“It will not fall on its side, not for anything, we will survive!”\n```\nHe only shrugged his shoulders, and I understood that like his indulgence to my childish\nincomprehension of the menacing death. In the meanwhile it was as though getting brighter. Now I could\nalready see the living hell of the water in which we were sailing, if one could name the horror of falling\ndown into an abyss and rising up into an unseen height “a sailing”.\n\nThe sea turned into a whole, white and boiling mass. As though hollowed out walls of the\ngreen water with the peaks of white foam would rise from time to time. They were threatening to flood us\nfrom all sides right away, but the captain’s command and deft hands of the people were piercing through\nthe barriers of the water, and we would dive downward, so that then we could get upward successfully. But\nthen I noticed that the captain pulled is head into his shoulders, he shouted something to I. and leant on\nthe wheel with his entire body. The tall and white Florentian’s figure appeared to me again. He touched I.’s\nhands and then he turned the wheel exactly so as the captain wanted it to, but was unable to do it in any\nway, even with the help of all of his assistants. And now the steamer turned obediently with its front to the\nright. I had my heart in my mouth: the highest mountain of the water was drawing nearer straight to us, on\nthe top of which a column of the water was whirling. It was so high that it seemed that it was really\nsupporting the sky.\n\nIf this mountain had hit the ship’s side, then it would have capsized inevitably. Thanks to the\nswift manoeuvre, the steamer pierced through the gigantic mass of the water with its spike, and the whole\n\n\nweight of the water fell on its stern. The thunder was heard, as though the cannons had fired; the ship\ntrembled, its spike rose upward as on the swing, but in a moment we were sailing in the foam of the\nroaring sea again, where the waves were still terrible, they would flood the deck, but they didn’t menace to\ncrash us anymore.\n\nHaving come to myself, I started looking with my eyes for my wonderful friend Florentian,\nbut I understood that it was only a mirage, the mirage of my love to him. I was so immersed in my thoughts\nabout him, I believed in his help so much, that he appeared to me even here.\n\n“We are saved,” the captain uttered. “We’ve sailed across the zone of the hurricane. The\ntossing will still continue for a long time, but there’s no deadly danger anymore”\n\nHe offered me and I. to go to the cabin and to rest, but I. answered him that we were less\ntired than him and that we would stay with him until we sail out of the danger zone once and for all, that\nhe could offer his chief assistant to rest, who was the most tired and that he could invite somebody else\nhere.\n\nThe captain sent his chief assistant to find out how the passengers were feeling and told him\nto change places with any of the assistants on duty for a couple of hours, and that the person who would\nchange him would bring an answer about the ship’s condition.\n\nI don’t know how much time had passed. It became brighter. The storm was still violent, but\nit seemed to me that the captain’s face became brighter, too: he was worn-out, his eyes had sunk, his face\nwas blue pale, but the sternness in it had already been gone.\n\nI. turned to me and gave a cry that I should give a pill from Ali’s black box for everybody. I\nthought that the tossing wasn’t so strong anymore, I came out of my corner and I would have fallen down\nfor sure if I. hadn’t held me.\n\nI was surprised very much. Several hours ago, in the full swing of the hurricane, I was serving\nout the medicine to everybody so easily, and now I was unable to do it without I.’s help, although the\nelement had already abated. It was difficult for me, but I gave a pill for everybody. I made lots of efforts\nuntil I swallowed it myself and then I could hardly come back to my previous place.\n\nOnly now I noticed that there was a pull-down chair in this corner. I pulled the chair down\nand sat down on it, perplexed. Why when Florentian appeared to me, in the moment of the greatest\ndanger, I could move easily, and now I couldn’t even take a step, it wasn’t easy even to sit down, I had to\nhold on the grip?\n\nDid only the thought about my dear friend whom I was calling for help from the bottom of\nmy heart during the whole night help me to focus my will so much? I remembered what a joy had filled me\nup back then; how I perceived that I was strong; how I was laughing by giving the pill to the captain, and\nnow I got absolutely absent-minded and I became the ordinary Lovushka, the catcher of the crows.\n\nI was looking at the sky, and it seemed to me that it wasn’t so grey anymore. The difference\nof the colours came to light between the white, bubbling sea and the grey sky. The wind wasn’t so strong\nanymore. The whistling and rumbling, as though the ordnance was firing, could be heard always rarer,\nwhile the people who were standing at the rudder were already exchanging some words one with another,\nnot shouting at the top of their voices.\n\nThe heavy steps could be heard, and the shift marched in to change the chief assistant and\nour clumsy sailor.\n\n\nBut our sailor was still feeling so well that he didn’t agree to change, while every man was\nneeded downstairs. The captain passed the management to the new assistant, he took the sailor who had\njust come and, having told us that he would be back soon, he came down. He offered me to go with him.\nHe called me the bold spirit and the hero, but I knew better what kind of a hero I was when I was left with\nmyself, so I refused his offer resolutely.\n\nI wanted to stay upstairs also because I remembered the stifling air of the lower decks,\nbesides the sea was changing so much that it was really a pity to leave this view.\n\nThe truth is, it was still cold. And if the sun hadn’t been scorching so much when we were\nboarding the steamer, now I wouldn’t believe that we were sailing across the southern sea.\n\nAll of a sudden it was broad daylight round us; the wind ripped open the black clouds, and\nhere and there one could already see the little patches of the blue sky. The tossing was noticeably\ndecreasing; at times the wind would totally abate, and only the murmur of the sea was heard. The sea now\nwas absolutely black, only the crests of the high waves were showing brightly white.\n\nIt was easier to steer the rudder already. I. came to me and told me that when the captain\nwas back, we would go downstairs and, having done our mission of compassion one more time, we would\ngo to sleep. He offered me to go to the stern and to take a look at that hell from which we had just\nescaped. The clumsy sailor wanted to go with us, but I. told him that we were going only for a walk on the\ndeck and that then we would come back, but when we go downstairs, we would certainly take him with us.\n\nThe tossing was still strong, at times a wave used to come howling, but it wasn’t menacing\nour gigantic steamer anymore. Nevertheless, it was still difficult for me to go along the deck, and I was\nwondering how everything was easy for I.; whatever he used to do, he would do it splendidly. For no\napparent reason I was imagining him to be a tailor. It was so funny and stupid that I burst out laughing.\n\nI. was surprised, he looked me up and down and told me that for the second time already I\nwas demonstrating my heroism with a laughter.\n\n“No, heroism isn’t the cause of this laughter,” I answered him, “but only my stupidity. All of a\nsudden I was imagining you to be a tailor and I decided that you would do that job perfectly, too, but the\nvery fact that you were with the needle and the thread seemed to be so comic to me that I lost my self-\ncontrol and I burst out laughing.”\n\nWhen we approached the stern, my laughter stopped at once and I even felt that I remained\nlike this – with my mouth opened.\n\nIt seemed as though someone had cut the sea with the knife into two unequal parts.\nRelatively small space across which we were sailing was black, it was foaming with white foam, but it didn’t\nexcite any horror. The huge mountains of the water were stretching behind this black zone; the walls of the\ngreen water with the white crests were breaking when they hit one another, like the giants who were\nwrestling in the arms of the death; having wrestled for a moment, they would fall down into the abyss from\nwhich the new water monsters kept rising.\n\n“Have we really escaped this hell?” I was asking I. “Is it really possible to survive in these\nwaves?”\n\nI wanted to ask I. very much if during the most terrible moment he also was thinking about\nFlorentian, but I was ashamed to unbosom my naivety, the play of my fantasy, which had taken the shape\nof my dear friend – of my friend who had saved my life several times during this short period of time. And\n\n\nnow I was also calling him with all my heart, I was thinking about him more than about my brother or even\nabout myself.\n\nI. was standing in silence. Such serene peace was in his face, such deep purity and joy was\nshining within him that unawares I asked him what he was thinking about now.\n\n“My boy, I thank life which today gave us one more possibility to breathe, love, create and to\nserve people with all our strength, nobly and irreproachably. Bless your new day, too. Perceive well that we\ncould die tonight if life’s grace and the people’s selfless heroism hadn’t saved us. Think a little that his day –\nthat’s your new life already. It is new, because it could happen so that you might not stand here today. Get\nused to meeting your new breaking day as the day of your new life where only you, you alone are making\nthe record onto the clean sheet of your day. During the entire night you didn’t feel any fear at least one\ntime, you were thinking about the people whose lives and health were in danger. You forgot about yourself\nbecause of them.”\n\n“Oh, how wrong you are, Lolion,” I gave a shout by calling him in this diminutive name for\nthe first time. “In truth, I was thinking neither about myself not about the danger, besides only now I\nunderstood the danger when I looked at that horror left behind us, at that zone of the hurricane from\nwhich we escaped. I wasn’t thinking about people, because I was thinking about Florentian, about what he\nwould say about my behaviour if he was next to me. I was trying to do everything as though he had held my\nhand. I was so full of these thoughts that in the most dangerous moment I saw my dear friend. It seemed as\nthough I could see him, I was feeling his help, and that’s why I was laughing so cheerfully by surprising the\ncaptain and perhaps you, too. So your opinion about me is probably better than I deserve it.”\n\n“Your laughter didn’t surprise me tonight, neither your joy nor your cheerfulness. I\nunderstood that you were seeing Florentian in front of you, and I understood how great your attachment\nand loyalty is to him. I think that if this loyalty of yours to him doesn’t begin to stagger – you will achieve a\nlot in your life by following him. And some day, you will become such help, such support for people, as he is\nfor you at the moment,” I. answered me.\n\nHere, at the stern one could see well that the storm was still raging. The murmur of the sea\nstill reminded me of the shots of cannons time and again. We still had to speak rather loudly by bending\nclose to one to another’s ear.\n\nThe distance between us and the zone of the hurricane kept increasing, and now that view\nwhich was horrible when we were close to it was incredibly terrible from the distance, too.\n\nIf a painter had been standing on the deck next to us and if he drew this unaccustomed\nrange of the sea colours, which was as though artificially divided into the black, menacing, but not\nespecially dangerous waves and the mountains of the green water rising behind the waves and bringing the\nreal death – then everybody looking at such a painting would think that the painter was delirious and that\nhe was painting the delirium of his sickly soul.\n\nIt was difficult to tear away from this severe view. The lightning and the heavy shower in the\nzone of the hurricane had ceased already, too, but the sky was still black, - and the little patches of the\nbluish velvet were stunning very strangely, they were flashing between the black clouds here and there.\n\n```\nThe voice of the captain was heard behind our backs.\n```\n“I’ve been cruising for twenty years, I’ve crossed all oceans, I’ve seen lots of storms –\nincluding the tropical ones, - but I haven’t experienced anything similar as tonight and I have never gone\n\n\nthrough such a power and so many columns of the whirlwind. Look!” suddenly he gave a shout loudly,\nturned to the left and he was pointing in the direction of his hand.\n\nTwo white and bubbling columns of the water, the peaks of which disappeared in the clouds,\nwere standing on the gigantic mountain of the water.\n\nThe captain rushed to the wheelhouse, I wanted to run after him, but I. stopped me, saying\nthat these columns wouldn’t harm us anymore, that they were moving sideways and that there wasn’t any\ndeadly danger.\n\nIndeed, the columns were moving sideways, but all of a sudden, I saw how the peaks of the\nwater wall on the right started rising upward and at the same time the stream of the water was turning\nround, and in a moment one more gigantic column of the water grew from it. With great speed it hurried\ntowards the columns on the left, which were approaching it, and suddenly all of them collided one with\nanother, there was a roar heard, as if the loudest thunder had struck right here – and an abyss appeared in\nthe place of the collision.\n\nThe line that separated the sea into two parts cleared away, and the wall of the water was as\nthough chasing us. That was so terrible that I was surprised and I looked at I., not understanding why he\ndidn’t hurry to help the people by the wheel. Being in silence, he took my arm and turned my face forward.\nI was amazed when I saw the clear sky and the outlines of the shore, which were revealing in the distance.\n\n“The captain is right that he rushed at the wheel. The waves will be hitting us strongly again\nand they won’t allow us to reach the shore. If there’s enough of coal, water and food reserve on the\nsteamer, it might be that we even won’t drop in at the first harbour and that we’ll keep sailing. The sea isn’t\nmenacing us with death anymore,” I. was talking to me. “Such hurricane could hardly repeat one more\ntime, but by judging from everything, the sea will remain stormy for at least a week.”\n\nI also could feel the stronger tossing already; the sea began to boil again and it was rustling\nwrathfully; the wind used to fly towards us in whistling squalls, but the waves weren’t reaching the height\nof the previous mountains anymore.\n\nWe went to the captain who was examining the shore through his binoculars. He changed\nthe ship’s course. He ordered to call urgently his chief assistant with the report about the reserve of coal,\nwater and food on the ship.\n\nWhen the chief assistant came, it turned out that the reserve of everything on the ship\nwould be sufficient for two more days, the captain commanded to sail to the open sea again, not turning in\nat the harbour.\n\n```\nI was convinced of I.’s foresight for the one hundredth time.\n```\nAlthough the strengthening medicine of Ali and Florentian was taking a miraculous effect,\nnot only mine, but everyone’s strength was exhausted already. Everyone who had spent the night here, on\nthe deck, looked more like the ghosts than people in the grey light of the gloomy day. Only I. alone was\npale, but brisk. The captain simply could hardly stand on his feet.\n\nHaving passed the operative management to two of his assistants and to the navigation\nofficer, the captain ordered to distribute a stronger ration of food to his sailors and to go to sleep. He\ninvited us to his cabin where we saw a perfectly laid table.\n\nAs soon as I sat down on the chair, I felt that I wouldn’t have enough strength to stand up\nagain. I don’t remember absolutely anything what happened next.\n\n\nI came to myself in our cabin. I was strong and cheerful, I had forgotten absolutely\neverything and I didn’t even comprehend where I was. Having lain for about a half an hour, little by little I\nstarted remembering and perceiving the surroundings.\n\nThe horror of the previous night returned together with my memory. Now the sun was\nshining already. I got up and put on a white suit which must have been prepared by the careful hands of I. I\nalready was about to find and thank him for his care and attention. Only I was unable to line up all events\ninto one line in any way and to understand how I got into the cabin.\n\nI was ashamed that I was sleeping for so long, while I., apparently, was giving help to people\nfor a long time already.\n\nExactly at this moment the door opened, and my friend entered the cabin. He was radiating\nwith cheerfulness. I became so happy, as though I hadn’t seen him for a year and I fell myself on his neck.\n\n“Thank God! Lovushka, at last you got up,” he told me, smiling. “I was already getting ready\nto drag the fire-hose, because I know your weakness for the waves.”\n\nIt turns out that I was sleeping for more than twenty-four hours. I couldn’t believe it in any\nway, I kept asking what time it was, when I fell asleep. I. told me how he had to bring me to our cabin in his\narms and to put me to sleep, being hungry.\n\nI wanted to eat awfully, but I didn’t have to wait for a long time, because the radiant clumsy\nsailor showed up in the door and reported that the breakfast was served already.\n\nShowing his teeth, with his gaze fixed on me, he gave me a note and whispered to me that it\nwas from the cabin No. 1A of the hospital, from the beautiful lady who was asking me to visit her.\n\nI was very embarrassed. That was the first secret note from a woman to me. I knew perfectly\nthat there was nothing in it what I couldn’t read to the first person that I met, not only I. I was angry with\nmyself for such an inexperience, inability to control myself and to remain a person of culture, not turning\nred like a lad.\n\nOnce again that short little word “tact” which the storm had blown out of my head came\nback to my consciousness. Having sighed, I was greeting it like a distant, unrealizable dream.\n\nThe stupid expression of the sailor who was scratching his chin and looking at me\nmischievously looked very comic, as though he was thinking: “Well, look what a bite he has grabbed, and\nwhen did he have time to do it?”\n\nI was always reacting to humour sensitively, so also this time I burst out laughing, the sailor\nwas sniggering, and I. was also laughing when he read all thoughts that were flashing in my face, because\nhe could do it perfectly. The comicality of this scene must have made the sternest person laugh. When I\ncalmed down and looked at I., he looked like a roguish conspirator and he was glittering his eyes not any\nworse than the yellow-eyed captain.\n\nI put the note in my pocket and declared that I would die of hunger if I don’t get any food\nright now. I was absolutely stunned with the news that it was two o’clock already.\n\nWe left the cabin and sat down at the table on the deck. I was eating everything what I. was\ngiving to me, while he himself was laughing, because he said that he was feeding a tiger for the first time in\nhis life.\n\n\nThe captain approached us. He greeted us cheerfully, called me a merry hero, stating that for\nthe first time in his life he saw a person who was rocking with laughter from the bottom of his heart in the\npresence of the deadly danger.\n\n“I’ll create a new sea legend,” he was speaking. “There’s a legend about the Flying\nDutchman. It is a spine-chilling legend, bringing death to every person met. There’s a merry legend about\nthe White Brothers who are saving ships and lives, but there’s still no legend about the merry Russian who\nis rocking with laughter in the moment of the menacing death and who is serving out the energy pills to the\npeople fighting against the element. In the report to my operative management I will inform them of all\nthat help that you and your brother have provided to me and everybody on the ship at night. About you,\nmy young hero, I will report individually to both my leaders and everybody on the ship, because the\nexample of such wild fearlessness is an extraordinary event.”\n\nI was sitting, totally blushed and embarrassed. I already wanted to tell the captain that he\nwas wrong by estimating my heroism so much, that I. was still guiding me by hand and that, apparently, I\nwas still a burden and not an assistance for him, but I. stealthily squeezed my hand and answered himself\nto the captain that we were very thankful to him for such appreciation of our night assistance. He also\nreminded him that the Turks accomplished no less than we did during the storm.\n\n“Oh, yes,” the captain answered him. “Undoubtedly, I won’t forget about them in my report.\nThey were also acting in a heroic and selfless way, but there’s a great difference to be inside of the\nsteamer, protected from the waves, and to be on the deck where a wave could sweep you off at any\nmoment. You’ve achieved a great deal, youth,” he addressed me again. “If you wanted to change your\ncareer and to become a sailor, I could make a protection for you in England. With such courage you would\nbecome a captain quickly. Now you will be accompanied by the glory of the fearless man in the water,\nright? And that is the guarantee of the high career in seafaring.”\n\nHe was glittering with his yellow catlike eyes and extending the glass of champagne to me. I\ncouldn’t refuse it and show myself impolite. The captain poured some champagne for I., too, and proposed\na toast to the health of the brave ones. He tossed his glass off at a draught and wanted to pour in the\nsecond one for himself, but one of his assistants called him with some urgent business.\n\nI., just like me, didn’t have any wish to drink the champagne. Without any prearranged plan,\nwe extended our glasses to the clumsy sailor who brought us some ice-cream. I didn’t even have time to\ntake my portion, and the glasses were standing empty already. I. told him to take the silver bucket with\nchampagne to the captain’s cabin, then he told me.\n\n“We should visit our friends Turks, so that we wouldn’t be impolite, if they don’t think of\nvisiting us here. They had already visited us for a couple of times and were asking about your health, you\nalso could be more polite with respect to the lady. Read her note at last,” he added, after giving me a smile.\n\nAs soon as I had time to feel the letter in my pocket, I heard the voices, and both Turks came\nup to our table.\n\nThey greeted me amiably and were glad that the storm hadn’t made me ill. The older Turk\nlifted his son’s fez a little, and I saw his shaved skin and a bandage stuck under it. It turned out that when\nthe wave tossed the ship upward, he tapped his head onto the beam. It turned out that I. was dressing his\nwound. His ointment was functioning so well that today he could only stick his wound and not dress it\nanymore.\n\nHaving stayed with us for a while, the Turks went downstairs to have their breakfast in the\njoint dining-room.\n\n\nFinally, I pulled the letter out and opened it.\n\n\n# Chapter 13\n\n## The unfamiliar lady from the cabin No. 1A of the hospital\n\nThe letter was addressed “to mister junior doctor”. The salutation in the letter was the same.\nIt was written in French.\n\n_“I’m very embarrassed to trouble you, mister junior doctor, but I’m worried about my girl;\nbesides, for some reason my boy is crying very often, too. I understand the tactlessness of my addressing to\nyou, but my God – there isn’t a single heart in the whole world, to which I could address in this hour of my\nsuffering and pain. I’m going to my uncle from whom I haven’t received any news for half a year already. I\ndon’t even know if he’s still alive. What is waiting for me in the strange city, not knowing their language, not\nknowing to do anything else except the hats for the ladies. I’m driving the sad thoughts away from me; I\nwant to be brave; I want to be brave at least for the sake of my children, as the mister senior doctor has told\nme to. The whole steamer is talking about your courage already. Stand up for me. A majestic, old, Russian\nduchess has settled in the cabin next to mine. She is indignant that somebody dared to move me, as she has\nput it “a beggar from the fourth class” into the best cabin, and she demands the doctor to throw us out. I\ndon’t dare to trouble the mister senior doctor or the captain, but I beseech you to protect me, don’t let her\nto throw us out. Persuade the majestic duchess to allow us to continue our journey in our cabin. We aren’t\neven leaving our cabin. Everything, even the bath is separate from her, and we aren’t troubling the peace of\nher majesty with anything. With the great hope that your young heart will hear my entreaty, I Joan\nMoranjer remain always thankful to you.”_\n\nI was trying to read this naïve and exciting letter calmly, but my voice trembled a couple of\ntimes, and I saw the face of poor Joan with the tears pouring from her eyes like peas in front of me.\n\nI raised my eyes to I. who was sitting next to me. I recognized that austere wrinkle on his\nforehead, which I was observing several times when I. had decided to do something.\n\n“Our silly clumsy sailor must have carried this letter during the whole day, hiding it from me\nand thinking that it was a little love letter,” I. was speaking to me, lost in thought. “Let’s go now, at once.\nLet’s find the captain, you will interpret the poor woman’s words to him. Take our first-aid kits, too. We will\nmake a round of the whole steamer at the same time, too.”\n\nHaving thrown the first-aid kits on our shoulders, we hurried to look for the captain. We\nfound him in the office and explained to him what the matter was. I saw how his eyes flashed and how his\nlips twisted, but he told us only this.\n\n```\n“Give me ten more minutes, and I will go with you.”\n```\nHe showed us to sit down on the leather sofa next to him and kept listening for the reports\nof the chiefs from all the steamer’s subdivisions about the storm’s consequences and for what has been\ndone by repairing the steamer and rendering assistance to the passengers according to his instructions.\n\n\nExactly in ten minutes – precisely, clearly, not uttering a single unnecessary word – he\ndismissed everybody and went with us to the hospital.\n\nOnce again by climbing the winding stairs, already familiar to me, we went straight in front of\nthe cabin No. 1A.\n\nLots of people had gathered in the corridor; a clear and firm voice of the doctor was heard, it\nwas as though contradicting somebody, and a squealing womanly voice stood out, which was speaking\nEnglish terribly.\n\n“If you don’t want to send her away from here, then I will do it myself. I don’t wish some\nnasty being cruising next to me. You have to do everything, so that the passengers who have paid such\nmoney for the journey wouldn’t have to worry.”\n\n“I repeat to you one more time that such is the captain’s instruction, and he’s the God on the\nship, not me. Besides, she isn’t a being – I’m totally amazed at the culture of your language – but she’s a\nkind and wonderful woman. She has paid in full for her journey in this cabin, while you keep excusing\nyourself with your nerves disturbed after the storm and you still haven’t paid for your cabin,” once again\nthe calm doctor’s voice was heard.”\n\n“How dare you to talk to me like this? You are a rude fellow. I won’t be waiting until you are\nso kind as to send the girl that you like away from here. You want to make yourself comfortable and to\nhave an amusement at your hand, on official account. I’m going myself and I will make her leave!” the\nduchess was squealing.\n\n```\nThe doctor became excited.\n```\n```\n“God knows what is going on here! You are talking not like an aristocrat, but like...”\n```\nThe captain stepped forward and blocked the door of the cabin No. 1A with his back, which\nthe old, awkward woman was coming nearer to. She was painted like a doll, she had a wig with the blond\ncurls on. She had smartened herself up with grey silks, she had golden chains, a lorgnette, a medallion and\na watch on. Her fat fingers had some expensive rings on.\n\nThis old woman who was trying to look younger than her age was even uglier, because she\nwas unable to stand firmly on her feet. Still a young man with an elegant suit was holding her from one\nside. His face was very sad. From another side – apart from the stick on which she was leaning – a\nhousemaid with a bluish dress, a white elegant apron and a white hood on her head was holding her.\n\nIt seemed that she didn’t know the captain and, seeing only a sea officer with two youths at\nthe door of the cabin, she began to squeal in even a thinner voice and, tapping her stick to the floor in a\nthreatening way, she gave a scream.\n\n“I will complain to the captain! What kind of a guard is here at the door of the lewd being?\nMy husband is young, there are lots of young girls here. This is a lewdness! Let me go immediately. I will\ntake care of it myself...”\n\nShe didn’t finish her speech, the captain interrupted her. He raised his hand at his cap\npolitely and told her.\n\n“Be so kind as to show your ticket for the cabin No. 2 in which, as I can see, you have settled.\nI’m the captain.”\n\n```\nHe whistled in his own way, and a couple of strong sailors ran into the corridor.\n```\n\n“Make sure there are no outside persons left in the corridor, who aren’t cruising in the\ncabins of the hospital,” he commanded them.\n\nThe captain’s command that was uttered in his metal voice was fulfilled immediately. The\ncrowd of the curious persons disappeared immediately, only the old woman with her assistants, the doctor,\nthe trained nurse and me with I. were left. The old woman was looking at the captain impudently with her\nsmall and angry eyes, apparently imagining herself to be such a peak of majesty, in front of whom\neverybody had to fall in prone position.\n\n```\n“It seems that you don’t know who I am,” she kept speaking in a squealing and arrogant way.\n```\n“I know that you are cruising on the steamer entrusted to me, in the cabin No. 25 of the first\nclass. When you were boarding the steamer, you read the rules that during the journey all passengers, as\nwell as the team, obey to the orders of the captain. There were also the posters put that there were the\ncabins of the hospital available on the steamer for the separate price. Now you are exactly here. Please\nshow me your extra ticket,” the captain answered her.\n\nThe old woman threw her head back proudly, stating that they shouldn’t be speaking about\nher ticket, but about that woman from the adjacent cabin.\n\n“The doctor took his friend out of the hold and settled her in the best cabin with all separate\nconveniences. I, the brightest duchess, demand to move her back to her previous place immediately,\nexactly where it suits her best,” the old woman was demanding with her terrible English in a high tone.\n\n“Do you, dear, understand what I am asking you? I’m asking you to show me the ticket for\nthis cabin. If you don’t show it to me right now, soon you will be moved back to the cabin No. 25 for which\nyou have paid, in addition you will have to pay a triple fine for sailing without the ticket in the hospital.”\n\nIt seemed that the captain’s voice and especially the threat of the fine touched the most\nunpleasant string of the greedy old woman. She blushed, her head began to shiver, she wanted to say\nsomething else, but she was only panting out of anger and she had a suffocating cough.\n\n“In addition, the breach of the determinate rules and the captain’s orders, the contradiction\nto his instructions on the ship is called a riot. So if you allow yourself to utter at least one more word, at\nleast one more tapping of the stick which is disturbing the peace of the patients, I will command these\nstrong men to send you into the solitary like a rebellious element.”\n\nNow the old woman herself was already frightened, not to speak of her young husband who\nmust have been absolutely stunned at his situation in this scandal and who couldn’t understand the mean\nbehaviour and the whole shame of the old woman, his wife.\n\nThe captain ordered to open the door of the hospital’s cabin No. 2 in which the old woman\nwas travelling. The view which opened up in front of my eyes made even me to double up with laughter.\nThe widest feminine pants were hanging in the most visible place, not the cleanest at all. The beds were\nmuddled up, as if somebody had twisted and rolled in them. All sorts of the clothes, even the most\nintimate, were scattered everywhere – on the tables, chairs and on the floor.\n\n“What kind of the Gipsy encampment is that?” the captain gave a shout. “Nurse, how could\nyou allow such a mess on the steamer, and even at the hospital?”\n\nThe nurse, an elderly Englishwoman, who was full of understanding of her value was\nexplaining that she was in the cabin three times herself, she sent a servant to tidy up the cabin two times,\nbut in half of hour everything looked as though after a massacre again. Everybody was asking the duchess\n\n\nabout her ticket, while the cashier even went looking for the captain, but apparently, they had missed each\nother.\n\nThe captain whistled again, and a junior officer came hurriedly. He received the captain’s\ncommand to move the duchess back into her first class cabin instantly, to demand and obtain the triple\nprice from her for taking two places in the hospital as the fine for travelling without the ticket and to wash\nthe cabin immediately.\n\n```\n“I will complain to your operative management,” the old woman spoke in a wheeze.\n```\n“And I will complain not only to my operative management, but also to the Russian\nauthorities. Also I will tell about your behaviour to His Majesty grand duke Vladimir who will board our ship\nin the next harbour.”\n\nThen the junior officer went up to the old woman and offered her to follow him to the first\nclass. It was clear that the old woman was ready to scratch the captain’s eyes out. Being so helpless, she\ngave vent to her anger to her husband and housemaid, calling them asses and idiots, not knowing even\nhow to hold her properly. Being like a Dante’s inferno creature with the shaking head, covered with lather,\ncoughing hoarsely like an old dog, the old woman disappeared in the corridor, accompanied by her\nassistants.\n\nThe captain said good-bye to us, asked to assure the lady Joan Moranje in his name that\nthere was no danger for her on the steamer and that English laws were protecting her. He also asked us to\nmake the round of the passengers of the third and fourth classes, because after dinner, in the evening they\nwould be moved back to their previous places which now were being washed.\n\nHaving told to wash and tidy the old woman’s cabin once again, the captain ordered the\ndoctor to accept only those passengers in it, whom I and I. would decide to send here. While saying good-\nbye to us, the captain added that his duty was starting at six o’clock in the evening and that we could find\nhim at the wheel. Soon he disappeared on the winding stair through which we had come down.\n\nWe knocked at the cabin No. 1A. A melodious female voice invited us in French: “Come in”,\nand it seemed to me that I could hear the tears in her voice.\n\nFirst of all, when I entered the cabin I made sure that the tears were really streaming down\nthe mother’s cheeks, while her children had buried themselves on her shoulders. As though being\nfrightened to see a scarecrow, they had put their arms round her and pressed close to her.\n\nThe mother was sitting squeezed into the corner of the sofa. All of them were so horror-\nstruck, they were so disappointed that I simply became rooted to the floor and turned into Lovushka – the\ncatcher of the crows.\n\nI. pushed me and whispered to me that I should take the girl in my arms and soothe her\nmother, like the captain had told me to.\n\nHaving made sure that we were wishing her happiness and that we brought her only joy, the\nmother kept asking us if she really could stay in this cabin with her children up to Constantinople. It seemed\nthat there was no end to her happiness. She was looking at I. like one is looking at the saint’s picture during\none’s prayer. She addressed me like a brother who could protect her on the earth.\n\nThe girl wound her arms round my neck and didn’t listen to any persuasions of her mother\nanymore to get off my knees. She was kissing me, stroking my hair and she felt sorry for it to be so short.\nShe was telling me that she was dreaming of me and that she would never part with me, that I was her true\n\n\nuncle, that she knew exactly that the benevolent fairy would certainly send me to her. Soon the little strong\nman also settled on my knees, and the pranks started, which I was enjoying, too. I would even excite them\nwith all sorts of tricks.\n\nIn the beginning their mother was trying to take the children from me, but now she was only\nlaughing merrily and she probably wanted to romp a little with us, too, but the presence of I. to whom she\nwas simply praying put her in a much serious frame of mind.\n\nI. asked her what they were eating. It turned out that they hadn’t had anything in their\nmouths since the early breakfast, because from that time their raging neighbour was always demanding to\nthrow them out, while we came only to the finale of this tragicomedy.\n\nI. told her that she had to feed her children immediately and to put them to bed, that she\nalso had to eat herself, to take a bath and to sleep a little if, of course, she wanted to, so that her and her\nchildren’s health would recover until they reach Constantinople.\n\nI. diagnosed that the girl had a slight, intermittent fever, that today she was healthy, but\ntomorrow she would have an attack again. Her mother’s eyes became widely opened out of horror. I. was\nsoothing her, telling her that he would give the girl some medicine and that they would have to spend as\nmuch time as possible on the deck of the hospital, lying on arm-chairs, then they would recover faster from\ntheir utter physical exhaustion.\n\nHe asked Joan to take care of the food immediately, he calmed her, explaining to her that we\nwould make the round of the passengers of the steamer and would come back to her in a couple of hours.\nThen we will give the medicine to her and her children to drink and we will talk.\n\nWhen we were leaving we also asked the trained nurse to feed the children and their mother\nmore substantially. She must have been a kind woman: the children were reaching for her immediately,\nand we left calm about their destiny at least at this day.\n\nWe hadn’t made several steps when the doctor met us and asked to visit that girl and her\nmother from the first class, whom we cured.\n\n“They passed the whole storm sleeping, now they are as fresh as roses and they would like to\nsee the doctor who has helped them so much, so that they could thank him personally,” the ship’s doctor\nwas telling us.\n\nWe followed him to the cabin and saw two very elegantly dressed brunettes who were\nsitting in arm-chairs, reading books and who didn’t remind of those helpless creatures of the stormy night\nat all.\n\nWhen the ship’s doctor introduced us to them, the older woman stretched both of her hands\nout to I., sincerely thanking him for saving them.\n\nShe was sputtering Italian words so quickly, with all expansiveness which was characteristic\nto that nation that I didn’t understand half of that flow of her words, although I myself could speak that\nlanguage well; I only understood that she was thanking us for their saved lives in the name of both of them.\n\nThe girl wasn’t a beauty, but her big, black eyes were so gentle and kind that they suited any\nclassical beauty. She also stretched both of her hands out and asked us for permission to show her\ngratitude in something.\n\nI. answered her that personally we didn’t need anything, but if they wanted to show their\nkindness, we wouldn’t refuse their help. Both ladies expressed their ardent wish to help us. I. told them\n\n\nabout the unfortunate widow Frenchwoman with two small children, who had lost her husband in an\naccident, who was saved by the captain from starvation and the storm by giving shelter to both her and her\nsick children in the hospital.\n\nBoth women were touched by poor widow’s destiny and they pulled their wallets out, but I.\ntold them that we would get the money for them, but that the poor lady needed some clothes and at least\na complementary linen.\n\n“Oh, this is absolutely simple,” younger lady was speaking. “Both of us can sew perfectly, we\nwill find the material and will dress them up smartly. Just introduce us to them and don’t worry about\nanything else. We’ll try to repay you by giving help to your friend.”\n\nI. warned them that the poor lady was frightened. He told them in a few words about the\nnasty experience of the old duchess. Both woman felt vexed through tears. They told us that not all ladies\nwere feeling and thinking like gorgons.\n\n```\nWe agreed to take them to Joan when we come back after making our round of the steamer.\n```\nWhile we were saying good-bye one to another, I. told me to pull Ali’s box out. He divided\none of the pills into eight parts, melted one of the parts in water, gave it for the girl to drink and told her to\nlie down for a while until we came back.\n\nWe came down to the third class. Everything here was already put in order, there weren’t\neven any tracks of the storm left, but the people were still lying down, not having enough strength to move.\nOnly several Turks looked brisker, while the Gipsies were worthy of compassion. Now the sea was\nprovoking such a horror for them that they crushed into several cabins and were frightened even to take a\nlook at the water.\n\nIn the beginning they were afraid of us, too, but when the first ones of them decided to take\nour drops, when they stood up and started walking on the deck, the rest of them were asking themselves\nfor the wonderful homoeopathy.\n\nSoon all cabins became empty, and when an officer came and asked everybody to come back\nto their own places in the fourth class which was already put in order and prepared for them, the\npassengers dashed downstairs. They were joking, often they were doing so rather dirty.\n\nThe women themselves decided to settle in that shielded part of the deck where they were\nmoved before the storm. They pushed all men out of there, and that was also accompanied with obscene\nand indecent jokes of the Gipsies.\n\nUnwittingly, I thought about calm and tender poor Joan. The captain saved her from so many\nmenacing dangers!\n\nHaving left everybody recovered downstairs, we went to the third class, but here we met\nboth Turks who had already had time to make the round of it. Then together with them we passed on to\nthe second class where everybody was healthy, only there were many weak ones. Majority of them were\nstill lying, not having any strength even to eat, and our medicine really came in handy here.\n\nWhen we went up to the first class we found everybody annoyed here. It turned out that the\nduchess who went into overdrive in the hospital was pouring her helpless anger on her husband and\nhousemaid, so the neighbours from the next cabins lost their patience and expressed their opinion about\nsuch a behaviour. Word after word and there was a scandal into the very height of which we stepped.\n\n\nHaving seen us, the old woman thought that the captain was also with us. She was frightened, so she shut\nthe door of her cabin loudly and hid herself there.\n\nShe was accompanied by the joint laugh of everybody. The public here was feeling better,\nbut the weak patients were lying in some of the cabins. An elderly man approached us. He must have held\nout the storm with difficulty. He was sallow, he had bags under his eyes. He asked us to visit his daughter\nand his grandson, the state of whom worried him very much.\n\nHaving entered their cabin, we saw a pale, red-haired woman with long plait and a pale, thin,\nabout eight year old boy who must have been seriously ill. They were lying in their beds.\n\nThe elderly man addressed his daughter in Greek, she opened her eyes, looked at I. who had\nleant over her and told him in Greek.\n\n“I won’t survive until the end of this terrible journey. Don’t pay any attention to me. If you\ncan, please save my son and my father. If I die, my son won’t have anybody left from our relatives, except\nmy father. I become horror-struck when I think how they will be living,” and the tears started running from\nher eyes.\n\n```\nI. told me to pour some drops from the dark bottle and answered her in the same language.\n```\n“You will be absolutely healthy tomorrow. You had a heart attack, but the storm has\nsubsided, your attack stopped and it won’t repeat anymore. Take these drops, turn round on your right side\nand sleep. Tomorrow you will get up earlier than the others, you will be strong and you will nurse your son\nand your father, and we’ll do this for you today.”\n\nHe raised her hand that was as pale as an antique statue and poured the medicine into her\nmouth. Then he helped her to turn round, covered her and went up to the boy.\n\nHe was so weak that he could hardly open his eyes; it seemed that he couldn’t even perceive\nanything. I. was holding his thin, little hand for a long time, he was listening for his breathing and finally,\nasked the man.\n\n```\n“Has he been in such a state for a long time?”\n```\n“Yes,” he answered. “The ship’s doctor gave him all sorts of medicine several times already,\nbut unfortunately, his state is growing only worse. He’s as though fainted away from the beginning of the\nstorm, and nothing can help him. Is he really going to die?”\n\nThe old man’s voice began to quiver, tears showed up in his eyes and, having turned away\nfrom us, he covered his face with his hands.\n\n“No, there’s a long way till his death. But why haven’t you tempered his body with\ngymnastics and games? He’s sickly and weak not because he’s ill, but only because he’s become feeble due\nto the poor routine. If you want your grandson to live, always keep him in the fresh air, teach him to ride on\nhorseback, to row, to swim, gymnastics. In fact you are killing your child,” I. was explaining to him.\n\n“Yes, yes, you are right, doctor, but we are son unfortunate, nothing goes right with our lives,\nwe have lost all of our relatives so suddenly and now we are trembling one for another,” the old man was\nspeaking always with the same bitterness.\n\n“If you keep protecting one another like this, soon all of you will be dead. You, a man, should\nfind strength and energy within yourself, which namely your daughter lacks so much, and you should start\neducating your grandson in another way. And besides that, all of you must start a new life. If you agree with\n\n\nmy method of treatment, I will be responsible for your grandson’s life and I will be treating him. If you\naren’t going to follow my instructions, I won’t even start,” I. continued.\n\n“I stake my life on it that everything will be done as precisely as possible,” the old man\ninterrupted him.\n\n```\n“Well, let’s start then.”\n```\nI. uncovered the boy, pulled the warm socks off his thin feet, as well as his sweater and asked\nfor another shirt. While he himself was changing his clothes, he told me to melt a part of the pill from the\ngreen Florentian’s box and even a smaller part from the black Ali’s box in the half filled glass of water.\nWhen I put the part from the black box into the solution with the part from the green one, the water in the\nglass as though boiled up and became bright red.\n\nI. took the glass from me, put some more special drops from three little bottles into it and\nstarted pouring the mixture into the child’s mouth with a small spoon. While I was holding his head, I was\nthinking that the boy wouldn’t be able to swallow even a drop, but he did swallowed the mixture and also\ndrank the last sip from the glass himself.\n\nI put the child’s head on the pillow carefully. I. told me to take the biggest bottle out of the\nfirst-aid kit. He washed his hands, and I followed his example. Then he told me to stretch out the boy’s\nhand with his palm up, while he himself was rubbing and massaging his hand up to his shoulder with the\nliquid from that bottle, every time rubbing his palm powerfully. His hand turned from absolutely white into\nreddish one. It even reddened. In the same way he rubbed his another hand, too, then his legs and finally\nhis entire body. He oiled the boy’s temples, behind his ears and his vertex with the liquid from another\nbottle.\n\nNow the boy was all reddish, suddenly he opened his eyes and told that he wanted to eat\nvery much. The old man called the man-servant and ordered the hot chocolate and white bread, as I. had\nindicated him.\n\nWhile they were bringing the chocolate, I. gave the old man the medicine to drink and\nadvised him to eat, too. He was refusing in the beginning, but when they brought the food for the boy, he\ndecided that he could drink some chocolate anyway.\n\nI. offered him rather to eat some semolina porridge and to drink some coffee. He told him\nthat the chocolate didn’t serve him very well at the moment.\n\nWhen they brought the food for the old man, and while he was eating, I. didn’t take his eyes\noff the boy. He was observing him and kept asking him if he wasn’t cold, but the boy answered him that his\nentire body was burning, that he had never felt so warm. To the question if he had any pain, he answered\nthat there was a bolt in his head and therefore his forehead and his eyes ached very much, but now it\nseemed that the doctor had taken that bolt out, because it wasn’t screwing or griping pains in his eyes\nanymore.\n\nI. gave him some more drops and advised him to try to fall asleep. The boy agreed willingly,\nand indeed, he was sleeping in ten minutes, breathing equally and peacefully.\n\n```\n“And now it’s your turn,” I. told the old man by extending the medicine to him.\n```\nHe drank it with no objections. I. offered him to go to bed. He explained to him that we\nwould look in again in several hours and that now all of them should sleep peacefully.\n\n\nWe left this cabin in which we had stayed for so long. We passed by the crowd of the\nsmartened up ladies and gentlemen who already started to take their proudly elegant appearance and who\nwere even trying to wisecrack and to flirt.\n\nOur new acquaintances Italians were already waiting for us impatiently. They had prepared\nmany bundles of linen and clothes for Joan. I. was thanking both ladies, but he asked them to postpone\ntheir acquaintance and help till tomorrow, because today both the mother and her children were still very\ntired after the storm, they were even sickly weak. The Italians were very disappointed, they felt sorry for\nthe poor children and they said good-bye to us till tomorrow.\n\n```\nNot lingering anywhere else, we went straight to Joan.\n```\nIf I hadn’t slept all day, I would have probably already fallen down on the ground with\ntiredness due to this trip up and down the stairs and this constant encounter with different people, with\nthe sickly, passionate outbursts of their anger, fear and disappointment.\n\nIn Joan’s cabin we found her children still sleeping, while she was sitting in the corner of the\nsofa. She had her cleaned dress on, with combed hair, but her face was so sad and pale that my throat was\nsqueezed.\n\n“I have already stopped waiting for you,” she was talking to us, while her lips only gave a\nghost smile, because her eyes were already full of tears.\n\n“We were delayed, because we had to help one boy,” I. answered her with such tenderness\nin his voice, which I hadn’t heard from him up to now. “But why do you think that we could break our word\nand not to come? Are you really so suspicious and do you trust people so little?”\n\n“If you knew how I trusted people up to now and how cruelly I was disappointed in their\ngenerosity and benevolence, then you wouldn’t blame me for my fear to make a mistake this time, too. I’m\nafraid even of thinking about this magic help given to me. I’m still waiting that maybe my journey in this\ncabin is only a dream, that maybe it will clear like a fog and the only consequence of the fog will remain –\nthe dew of my eyes,” Joan was talking.\n\n“I feel for you from the bottom of my heart,” I. was talking to her, “but every man must\nremain energetic and fight instead of falling into a gloom or drowning in his own tears when the storm of\nlife befalls on him, even if it is as horrible and unexpected as this storm of the sea. Think for a while, what\nwould have happened to the people of this streamer if the captain and the ship’s crew had been confused\nand if instead of fighting against the hurricane, they would have surrendered to the element and allowed\nthemselves to be seized by fear? Your situation isn’t helpless. It is true, you have lost your husband, love\nand welfare at once, but you still have your children, this goal in your life was left. Why do you go back to\nyour past in your thoughts, which doesn’t exist anymore? It is impossible to lose your past for the second\ntime. Why do you think about your future with a horror, about which you don’t know anything and which is\nimpossible to lose as well. The future doesn’t exist, too. Only the present can be lost, this hurrying now, and\nthat depends only on man’s possessed energy and cheerfulness. Remember your behaviour and think for a\nwhile how much unnecessary suffering only because of your fear about your future you’ve experienced. Did\nthis fear help you by anything? And did at least one of those terrible scenes which your mind was creating\ncome true? Arrange your inner world exactly as you have tried to arrange your exterior. Throw out of your\nhead your thoughts about poverty and helplessness. Search for strength for your new life, activity and fight\nfor your own and your children’s lives and happiness in your faithful love to your dead husband. Don’t cry\nso badly. Remember that you bemoan only yourself, your loss, your ruined egoistic happiness. You think\nthat you bemoan your husband and his broken life, but what can we understand and know about the\n\n\ndestinies of the people which are passing us by? Think from your hard lot that your life could also stop\nsuddenly as it has happened to your husband. Live your life as if every moment you would give the last\nresponsibility of your care for your children and all those people with whom destiny brings us together.\nDon’t give up to sadness, be the master of yourself, forget yourself and think only about your children. Fill\nyour day not with your gloomy thoughts about poverty and helplessness, but try not to cry with all your\nloyalty and selfless mother love, no matter how difficult that would be. Hide your tears and fear from your\nchildren, with your example teach them kindness and to meet every daybreak with joy. Don’t be afraid of\nanything now. Even if your prediction proves correct that your uncle isn’t living in Constantinople anymore,\ndon’t lose your courage, put all your hopes not to other people, but rely upon yourself. Tomorrow we will\nintroduce you to two wonderful, very kind-hearted ladies. They will help you and your children to renew\nyour toilets with great pleasure. And concerning your job and a possibility to make a living in\nConstantinople for you with your children, then two our friends are cruising here, on this steamer, who\nown a rather big enterprise in Constantinople. Even if they don’t need a person who can speak French as\nperfectly as you do, they will help to find a job for you. Perhaps, you will have an opportunity to open a\nstudio of female hats or anything else what would allow you to provide for your own and your children’s\nlives. But it doesn’t matter in what way you would have to solve your problems, always try to remain\nabsolutely calm, concentrated and cheerful, your tranquillity and selflessness are the most important. One\nmore time I’m asking you, please stop crying. Don’t look back and try to think only about this now passing\nmoment and about what you are doing right now at this moment. Your children’s health is the most\nimportant for you now. I think that your daughter has caught a nasty form of fever, and you will have to be\nrather tired of nursing her.”\n\nI couldn’t take my eyes off Joan, just like she couldn’t take her eyes off I. I had never\nobserved a woman’s face for so long. Now I had seen so many expressions in it that it was simply\nimpossible to describe all of them.\n\nFirst of all, an endless astonishment was reflected in this face. Then a resentment and a\nprotest slipped. Such a disappointment and sadness replaced them that I already wanted to meddle into\nthe conversation and to explain I.’s words to her, which she must have understood wrongly, but little by\nlittle her face was clearing up and her weeping was dying away. The expression of a bliss was revealed in\nher eyes, which I had already seen when we visited her for the first time, and she was looking at I. like at a\nsaint painting.\n\nI. was talking to her in French. His speech was correct, but only with a little accent which I\nhad never noticed when he was talking in any other language. I thought for a while that he must have\nlearned French when he was already a grown-up.\n\n“I cannot express my gratitude for your and apparently, I won’t be able to understand\neverything what you were telling me here,” Joan was talking in a quiet and musical voice. “But I feel a\nwonderful change in my heart. That what you told me, that the loyalty of my love to my husband mustn’t\nbe the tears by bemoaning him, but it must be an activity for my children, that lit a light within me, it gave\nme an unspeakable self-confidence. I’m not a lady of leisure. I married my husband who was an ordinary\nworker against my parents’ will. My parents were well-off farmers, and I was their only daughter. They\nloved and spoiled me in their own way, but they insisted on me marrying our neighbour who was an\nelderly, rich and very stingy landowner, and I had an aversion for him. My parents were persuading me for\na long time. I was only sixteen years old and I was almost about to agree with this terrible marriage already,\nbut by chance, at the party at one of my friends I saw my future husband – Michel Moranjer. I understood\ninstantly that even death was unable to frighten me, and that I wouldn’t marry the rich old man. I was\ndancing with Moranjer during the entire evening, while he was begging me to keep a date tomorrow.\nNobody could distract my thoughts off Michel. I want through the real hell at home for six weeks. Both my\n\n\nmother and my father were nagging me so much that I remember that time with a terror up to now,\nalthough eight years have already passed. And then an opportunity offered me to come to Russia. We got\nto the factory of rubber products of a French company in Petersburg. We were living perfectly. I was\nworking at the French hat shop where the ladies were simply buying up the products of my job. We were so\nhappy and then...” and the poor lady burst into tears again.\n\n```\nHaving accumulated her strength, she finished her story in a voice that we could hardly hear.\n```\n“An accident happened, because the machine by which my husband was working was in bad\norder, but the manager kept dragging out the maintenance until an irretrievable disaster happened.”\n\n“Don’t reopen your old sores. Wipe your tears. Your children are waking up, you have to\npreserve your nerves. Your strength is also overtaxed,” I. kept talking to her tenderly like before. “Set\nyourself the nearest task of restoring the strength of your children. You must give the medicine to your girl,\nso that the new attack would be weakened, and tomorrow, in spite of the children’s weakness, you have to\nlay them down on the deck. We’ll come to you after the breakfast and help you.”\n\nJoan was listening to I. like one is listening to a prophet. Her cheeks were shining brightly,\nher eyes were burning, and so much strength and determination showed up in her entire weak figure that I\nwas stunned by that contrast of how she looked when we found her here and now when we were leaving.\n\nWe said good-bye to her and left, accompanied with the shouts of joy of the awaked kids,\nbecause they didn’t want to let us go in any way. When the door of the cabin closed after us, I felt an utter\nphysical exhaustion. I took the tragedy of the sincere Joan’s story so deeply to my heart, I was swallowing\nthe tears which were squeezing my throat so many times that I lost all my strength during that hour.\n\nI. took my arm, gave me a friendly smile and told me that he sympathized with me in the\nmeeting of the first difficult tests of my new life.\n\nI could hardly reach our cabin. We changed our clothes and sat down at the laid table where\nmy nurse clumsy sailor was already waiting for us.\n\nI didn’t want to eat anything for the first time and I didn’t want to talk about anything. In\ncomparison with the morning waves, the sea was calm, but the streamer was still being rocked strongly. I.\ngave me a sweet from his orange box. Because of it, my cheerfulness returned, but I still didn’t want to talk\nabout anything. I refused I.’s proposal to visit the Turks in an hour categorically and I told him that I already\nhad enough of people and that I simply needed to be alone and to be silent for a while.\n\n“My poor Lovushka,” I. was talking to me tenderly. “It is very difficult to pass from the naïve\nchildishness to the stormy life of a man, which instantly demands him to open and strain his every nerve\nand energy. Lately you already had many possibilities to observe the people’s destinies yourself, to hear\nthem talking about them. You see how unexpected the blows of life can be, how free a man in his\nconsciousness should be, with what flexibility he has to switch and join his new life, and how it is best not\nto wait for something from the future, but to act in every moment. He must act with love and overcoming,\nthinking about the general wellbeing, and not only about his personal success.”\n\nI. sat down on the arm-chair next to me, but we weren’t fated to be silent for a little longer,\nbecause suddenly the captain’s steps and his voice were heard on the stairs. He had already made friends\nwith us once and for all, he was simply idolizing me and calling me a merry fellow and a bold spirit,\nalthough I was trying to deny this as much as possible.\n\nI. rose and came to meet the captain, so I could stay alone. He invited him to come to his\ncabin.\n\n\nI really needed to be alone. My soul, my thoughts and feelings looked like the stormy sea,\nand the waves of my spiritual storm were attacking one another, they collided one with another, they\nbroke, foamed and bubbled, not bringing any calming to me, not drawing me to any conclusions.\n\nFrom hundreds of the events that had befallen on me unexpectedly I was unable to\ndistinguish a single one of them, in which a logical connection of things would have been completely clear\nto me. It seemed to me that I could see only some unreal mysteriousness everywhere, and I couldn’t\ntolerate neither secrets nor miracles. The words of Florentian often used to come to light in the chaos of\nmy thoughts: “There are no miracles, there’s only one or another level of knowledge,” but I couldn’t\nunderstand them, too.\n\nFrom all my feelings, all my impressions, two of them were prevailing in my soul: love to my\nbrother and love to Florentian. I had never loved a single woman. Not a single hand of a woman had ever\ncaressed me, I hadn’t experienced neither my mother’s nor my sister’s tenderness, but what love was, what\nthe real devotion was, not criticizing, but idolizing one – I perceived that, because I loved my brother-father\nso much that I was carrying out all my matters, all my deeds and actions in such a way as though my\nbrother had been next to me and I had consulted him for every move of spirit. There was only one thing\nthat I had kept to myself – that was my talent of a writer, but in this case I was following my desire to\nprotect my brother-father from his poor scribbler brother-son.\n\nThis love to my brother was the essence of my whole life, it was its foundation. With this love\nI was creating my present and my future, besides I was looking at the present from above, for me it was\nonly the introduction to that wonderful life which we would start living together as soon as I would finish\nmy studies.\n\nNow I had an opportunity to see my childish loss of sight. Earlier I wasn’t reflecting who my\nbrother was, how he was living. Now I could see the part of his life – both personal and social, - in which I\ndidn’t exist. It was the real disaster for me, almost as painful as Joan’s misfortune. And when I was crying\nfor her, I was also crying for myself...\n\nI didn’t understand anything: what role Nal was playing and is playing in the performance of\nmy brother’s life, what place my brother occupied in the revolutionary movement, how he was connected\nwith Ali and Florentian? The truth is, everything seemed like a miracle to me here, I perceived my great\nignorance and how I wasn’t prepared for that life which I had to step into now.\n\nI was thinking that one heart could love only one person and only once in its life, like I loved\nmy brother, and I didn’t notice at all how my heart broadened and let one more man in, who surrounded it\nas though with a bright ring and occupied it completely, leaving the images of my brother Nikolay in the\ncentre of that ring.\n\nI didn’t see double in my love to Florentian and my brother – I united both of loves within\nmyself, often merging both objects into one painful sigh of longing and a wish to meet them...\n\nI had never experienced such power of charm with which Florentian had enslaved me. A new\nand strange understanding of the word “enslaved” showed up in my consciousness. Actually, the captivity\nof my heart and my thoughts used to merge with some kind of charm and joy which that man was\nspreading round him. The entire atmosphere round him was breathing not only of the power and self-\nconfidence, but having gotten into it, I used to rejoice at my happiness to live one more day, one more\nmoment next to him.\n\nWhile being next to him, I wasn’t feeling neither fear nor doubts nor thoughts about\ntomorrow – this man was spreading only creative energy of an action into his surroundings.\n\n\nWith the absent-mindedness that was characteristic to me, I forgot about everyone and\neverything, I forgot the time, the place, my perception of the space disappeared – I was flying to my\nwonderful friend in my thoughts and I was so full of him that once again, like at night during the storm, it\nseemed to me that I could see him.\n\nAs though a round window opened in the dark clouds, and I saw the mirage of my dreams,\nmy Florentian with white clothes and his curly, golden hair.\n\nI rose from the arm-chair, ran to the border of the deck and as though I heard his voice: “I’m\nwith you, my boy. Remain loyal to me and you will reach your goal, you will help your brother, and we will\nsee each other again.”\n\nA stormy joy took hold of me. Some kind of a power flowed into my entire body, it became\nlike iron. I felt happy and unusually calm.\n\n“Well, how is my young friend, bold spirit – merry soul?” I heard the captain’s voice behind\nme. “It seems that the wonderful clouds of this evening are alluring you to the sky?”\n\nI was unable to understand what was going on right away, I also didn’t turn around right\naway, but when I did, it seemed to me that not only the captain, but even I. was surprised by my changed\nface, because both of them were looking at me wonderstruck...\n\nAs though wishing to protect me from the captain, I. embraced me and pressed to himself\npowerfully.\n\n“Well, the Russians can make surprises! What has happened to you? You are radiating\nbeauty like a jewel,” the captain was talking to me, smiling. “Well, here’s whom you can be! Now I’m\nalready not surprised at all that not only the beauty from the hospital, but also the young Italian and the\nGreek are asking only about you. Now I understand what the powers, besides your courage, are hiding in\nyou.”\n\nHaving looked at the dark clouds regretfully, in which the mirage of my love vanished, I\nanswered the captain silently.\n\n“You are extremely wrong. I’m not a hero or a Don Juan at all. I’m an ordinary Lovushka, the\ncatcher of the crows. Namely now I was catching my dream, but I didn’t catch it.”\n\n“Well,” the captain made a helpless gesture with his hands, “if it’s too little for you to disturb\nthe hearts of three women during three days – let’s not forget the storm, too – then I only have to add my\nold sea-dog’s heart which is riddled by life on the scales of your victories. Young friend, I’m your captive,\nlet’s come to drink brotherhood.”\n\nI was unable to refuse such a sincere invitation of the captain in any way, but it seemed to\nme that the obligation of politeness had never been so difficult for me.\n\n“Think about Florentian,” I. whispered to me. “It’s not always easy for him, too, but he’s\nalways charming. Now try to render his charm to the people round us.”\n\nThese words urged me for the new use of joy that was boiling in me. After some time both\nthe captain and the Turks who were present here were rocking with laughter from the play of my words\nand the causticity which I succeeded to express well.\n\n\nSoon the evening turned into the night, and early in the morning we already had to sail into\nthe B.’s harbour to replenish the water, coal and food supplies, and to unload the cattle and a part of the\nhorses, too.\n\n```\nHaving excused for being tired, we said good-bye to the company and went to our cabin.\n```\nWe still couldn’t sleep for a long time. I was sharing my thoughts, my longing for my brother,\nmy loyalty to Florentian, my mirage and the hallucinations of my hearing with I. I. was telling me that I\nshouldn’t think about the mirage and illusions, that I should think only about the main point of the words\nthat reached me. It wasn’t important how I received the news, it was important what kind of the news it\nwas for me and what powers it aroused within me.\n\n“Remember well the feelings of self-confidence and joy, which came into being within you\ntoday, memorize that peace which you felt deep in your heart when you seemed to see and hear\nFlorentian. If you ever have to start any great job, never doubt your success when those feelings are within\nyou. An absolute man’s loyalty to an idea, as well as his loyalty to love, will always lead him to victory.”\n\nI embraced I. powerfully and I kissed him. From the bottom of my heart I thanked him for\ntaking care of me and I went to bed, being reconciled myself to myself and to the whole universe, thanking\nlife for its light and beauty.\n\n\n# Chapter 14\n\n## Stop in B. and unexpected impressions in it\n\nIn the morning I woke up brisk and rested. I was dreaming of Florentian, and the feeling of\nthis meeting him and talking to him was so real that I even smiled to my ability to live with images.\n\nThe sun was shining, the tossing could hardly be felt, and the first thing that surprised me\nwas the shore in the horizon, which was decorated with subtropical plants. The clumsy sailor shot up next\nto me and he explained to me that soon we would sail into the small bay of B., showing the rather big and\ncharming town, stretched out in the distance.\n\nI. climbed up onto the deck, he greeted me very joyfully and offered me to hurry to drink my\ncoffee, so that we could still have time to drop in at Joan’s and to prepare her for meeting the Italians.\n\nWe sat down to have our breakfast. The captain went up to us, he was laughing and he gave\nme a perfumed letter.\n\n“My friend, you can tell others what a modest boy you are. The daughter was asking me to\nhand you this and she was always trying to avoid her mother seeing her,” the captain was talking to me,\nwhile tapping me on the shoulder.\n\nI was laughing, as I probably would have been laughing from anything today, because\neverything inside of me was laughing and rejoicing. I gave the letter to I. I told him that I was so hungry that\nI couldn’t tear myself away from the sandwich and I asked him to read the content of the letter for me.\n\nThe captain was indignant at such a light-mindedness of mine and he was persuading me\nthat only now he understood my childish inexperience in love affairs, and that I had to read the letters from\nwomen myself, because women were mysterious creatures and they could play me the most unexpected\ntricks.\n\nNevertheless, I convinced I. to read the note, besides I asked him to read it loudly, so that the\npostman would hear it himself.\n\n“Well, what an interesting boy,” the captain uttered, laughing and he took a seat at our\ntable.\n\nAs I expected, the letter was from the young Italian and it was very matter-of-fact one. She\nwas writing that both of them, she and her mother, were asking us to introduce them to our friend as soon\nas possible, because there were many good shops in B. where they could buy clothes, linen and foot-wear\nfor the children. Before doing so, they needed to fit the children and to dart a glance at their mother’s\nfigure. The letter ended with the post-script that we, of course, wouldn’t refuse to accompany them, that\nthey knew the town perfectly, but they would be glad to have a company of men who knew the local\nlanguage, because they might have trouble with the Russian language.\n\nThe captain was a little disappointed with the content of the letter, but he kept trying to\nmake me believe that it was only an innocent pretext, and that the sequel of the love story was foreseen\nboth tomorrow and on the day after tomorrow, because he could clearly see my reflection in the girl’s eyes.\n\nWe finished our breakfast. I was joking that the black eyes of the Italian would go well with\nthe yellowish eyes of my new friend, while I myself would rather wait for the blue ones, - I might be lucky.\n\n\nWhile joking, we were going downstairs and turned straight to Joan. Instead of a friendly\nmoral, the captain only rocked his head and shook his finger at me.\n\nWe found Joan worried. Both of her children were tossing, they were in fever. She told us\nthat her children woke her up at seven o’clock in the morning, they were very joyful, they drank some\nchocolate, but then all of a sudden, about half an hour ago, the youngster complained to her of a headache.\nThen her girl was also complaining of a headache. She didn’t even have time to put them to bed, and both\nof them were already raving in fever.\n\nI. examined the children carefully, he pulled a very nice, cut bottle out of his pocket, which I\nhadn’t yet seen, and gave children the medicine to drink.\n\n“Don’t worry,” he addressed Joan. “It could have been even worse. The fever will be gone in\na couple of hours, and the children will feel well again, but that doesn’t mean that they will be recovered.\nI’ve warned you that you would still have to take a considerable care of them, right?”\n\n“I’m ready to take care of them during my entire life, I only wish that they would be healthy\nand happy,” Joan answered him by holding her tears heroically.\n\nI noticed a change that had happened within her. One cannot say about such young woman\nthat suddenly she became old, but my heart was aching from the thought that only now she was really\nstarting to understand her entire situation, and a grief was already taking root within her.\n\nI. asked her to bring the children on the deck, to tuck them in blankets and to leave them\nuntil our next visit. He offered Joan to lie down on the little wicker bed next to them. He warned her that\nthe children would wake up absolutely healthy in two or three hours, but she had to hold them in their\nbeds, to feed them and to keep them amused with the toys which we would bring her from the town.\n\nHaving helped her to lie down next to her children, we told her that we would be back soon\nwith our friends whom we had already mentioned to her, but that she had to stay in her bed and to talk\nwith the guests in a lying position.\n\nWe hurried to the Italians whom we found already prepared to go to the town. Having\nwarned them that Joan and her children were still sick, we accompanied them to her.\n\nHaving entered the Joan’s cabin, both women embraced her sincerely, they went up to the\nchildren on their tip toe and carefully and almost fell into tears, because they were so touched by their\nbeauty, weakness and their feverishly burning little cheeks.\n\nBoth Italians and Joan were very tactful and attentive. Contrary to the temperament and the\ntattle that was characteristic to this nation, they were speaking little, but their every word and movement\nwere telling about their respect and sympathy to the pain of the poor mother.\n\nThe young Italian fitted the feet and the little bodies of the children very tenderly and\ncarefully; of course, I helped her. The spasms of pain distorted her face several times, her heart must have\nalready experienced the drama of love and heartbreak, too.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the senior lady fitted Joan, although she was insisting that personally she\ndidn’t need anything, that all children’s clothes were instantly stolen on the steamer, as soon as she turned\naway from the suitcase.\n\nThe ladies said good-bye to Joan. They asked her to take care of her health, to think only\nabout her children and to leave the worries about the clothes to them. Having smiled to Joan tenderly, the\n\n\nItalians left. I followed them, while I. still lingered by the children and he caught up with us only on the\nlower deck where the little gangways to the shore were already stretched out.\n\nThe steamer had to stop at the harbour during the entire day and to cast off only at nine\no’clock in the evening. We didn’t need to hurry anywhere, but I. wanted to buy the toys for the children as\nsoon as possible, so that after waking up, they would stay in their beds until the evening.\n\nThe town to which we came was very cosy and beautiful, it was all buried in verdure. The\nrarest trees were growing in parks, houses were mostly one-storeyed and white.\n\nSoon we found a toy shop, picked out a pile of different toys and sent them to Joan whose\nsad look kept following me.\n\nI wanted to bring the toys to her myself, but I. whispered to me that we would buy the\nclothes for Joan and her children together with the Italians and accompany them back to the steamer, then\nwe would have to hurry to visit one of Ali’s and Florentian’s friend, where some news might be waiting for\nus and, depending on those news, we would either had to continue our journey by the steamer to\nConstantinople or to ride on horseback towards the Turkish border and to try to get there by land, and that\nwould be more difficult and would take more time.\n\nI was terror-struck. I wanted to shout out: “And what about Joan?”, but I. only put his finger\nto his lips, took my arm and answered to some question of the Italians.\n\nI was stunned by the possible separation with Joan. Her destiny without us was like a splinter\nstuck in my heart. I turned into Lovushka the catcher of the crows in a flash, everything went clean out of\nmy mind, and if not the strong I.’s hand which was controlling my mechanical walking, I must have been\nstanding like hammered in one place.\n\n“Think about Florentian. Could he be so absent-minded, ill-mannered and disobliging? Go,\noffer your hand to the young lady and be such a cavalier as if you were next to Joan if you had to\naccompany her. Politeness is obligatory for a friend of Florentian,” I heard I.’s whisper.\n\nDuring these days which were passing so quickly, again and again I used to make sure how I\nwas lacking experience, how I still couldn’t control myself, how it was difficult for me to learn the art of self-\neducation. The picture of my brother flashed in my mind; his iron will and his chivalrous politeness while he\nwas talking to Nal in the garden. I used simply inhuman efforts, even physically I felt stress from my head to\ntoe, I let I’s hand go, went up to the girl, took my hat off, bowed to her and offered my arm to her.\n\nHer small face with big eyes brightened up, she gave a smile and she all changed somehow,\nshe became kind, and I understood instantly what this face was lacking in order to be attractive: the\nsadness which was reflected in it and disappointment was covering it like a dead mask.\n\n“It seems that in this case mother-life asked a black pearl in her string, too”, I remembered\nAli’s words in my thoughts.\n\nMy pity for the girl helped me to forget my own mood, and I started looking for possibilities\nto dispel her sadness.\n\nI started by telling her my surname, I explained to her that I was a Russian, I apologized to\nher that in confusion of the storm and dangers, me and my brother forgot to observe the etiquette and we\nhadn’t introduced ourselves to her up to now.\n\nThe girl answered me that she found out my surname from the ship’s journal of the\npassengers, and that it wasn’t difficult to do at all, because there was only one luxurious cabin.\n\n\nShe told me that they descended from Florence, but they’ve been living in Petersburg at her\nmother’s brother for two years already, that after her experienced big disaster her mother took her for a\njourney, so that she would forget Italy and all her memories related to it.\n\nThen she told me that her name was Maria Galdoni, while her mother’s name was Giovana\nGaldoni and that they were going to Constantinople to visit her mother’s sister, signora Terez, who married\na diplomat, hence the destiny moved her to Turkey. She asked me where I and my brother were going. I\nanswered her that first of all we were going to Constantinople, and that I didn’t know our next itinerary.\n\nIn this way we went up to the main street and entered the shop of the knitwear. Here I and I.\ngave the initiative to signoras Galdoni, but at the shop of the readymade clothes I decided to meddle in the\nshopping of the Italians. Both of them were picking out bright and light-coloured items, while I chose a blue\ncostume made of Chinese silk, a white batiste blouse and a small English hat made of the rice straws with a\nblue band for Joan. I. bought a grey coat and a flannel dress for the girl and a coat and a flannel suit for the\nboy. The Italians were stunned by our taste and choice, but we held out their pressure by explaining to\nthem that there would be not only sunny days.\n\nWe still had to buy the foot-wear for them, and I showed the fortitude of my character by\nbuying a pair of the travelling little shoes on the high sole of Joan. I. was laughing and he let the ladies buy\nthe foot-wear according to their taste by saying that otherwise we would buy up all goods. We bought two\nsuitcases, put all our purchases into them, except the hats, of course, got on a hired coach and rattled off to\nthe steamer.\n\nI had a seat next to signora Maria again. The conversation was turning upon the storm and\nits consequences, as well as upon my courage which the captain had already turned into a legend.\n\nWhile we were approaching the steamer, we encountered the whole crowd of cheered up\nand rested passengers from all classes, who were hurrying to the town.\n\nThe group of the dressed up ladies from the first class were demonstrating the smartness of\ntheir clothes, they were making their eyes at men, while the men were trying to parade their wit, swiftness\nand aristocracy of their manners. They were trying to display their qualities in every possible way after I had\nseen the wrong side of them during the storm. That aroused the feeling within me that was close to\nnausea.\n\nWe were acquainted with many of them, we helped many of them during the storm. I saw\nhow impatient they were. Their rude behaviour with the crew of the ship, an absolute sluggishness of these\ndandies in a moment of danger hadn’t yet died out of my memory.\n\nIn no way I could throw out of my head a thought about a herd of two-legged beasts who\nhad a new chance to demonstrate their physical qualities, so that they would excite passions and, having\nbecome involved in this tempting game, they would spend their day on land pleasantly.\n\nWe accompanied the ladies up to Joan’s cabin, said good-bye to them, and to the question\nwhen we would see each other again, I. answered them that most likely only in the afternoon when we\ncontinue our journey; they became sad after hearing that, because they were expecting to spend the whole\nday in our company.\n\nHaving gone upstairs to the first class, we met the Turks and together with them we came\nback to the town.\n\nThis time we turned to the opposite direction, not to the centre, but to the outskirts of the\ntown. We were going along a wonderful boulevard of the sea-shore, which was buried in blooming\n\n\nmimosas, reddish and yellow acacias and palms. We went into a peaceful, little street and gave a ring at the\ndoor of a beautiful, white house which was surrounded by a garden.\n\nThe way was short, I was going next to the younger Turk and I had time only to ask him how\nthe wound in his head was healing.\n\n```\n“My head is almost healed, but my leg still hurts,” he answered me.\n```\n```\n“Why don’t you show it to I.?” I asked him.\n```\nHe answered me that he still didn’t have a chance to speak to I. alone, without his father,\nbecause he didn’t want to worry his father and he was hiding his hurting leg from him. I took a good look at\nhis face and I understood immediately that the youth was seriously ill. Not having uttered a word, I\nwhispered to I. that our young friend had a serious wound in his leg, which he was hiding from his father.\n\n```\nI. nodded his head, but the door opened right at that moment, and we entered inside.\n```\nThe white, little house with mezzanine looked quite modest from the outside, but inside it\nwas a realization of cosiness. The big antechamber that looked like an English hall was separating the house\ninto two parts. Half of the walls were boarded with the decorative boards from Karelian birch; the peg-\nboard, chairs, armchairs and tables were made of the same tree. The remaining part of the walls was\npapered with blue Morocco-leather. Large branches of mimosas were stretching down from above. The\nfloor was covered with the bluish carpet, decorated with white and yellow flowers. I stopped like charmed.\nIt was so easy to breathe here, as though... I turned into Lovushka the catcher of the crows instantly and I\neven couldn’t perceive in which place of the terrestrial globe I found myself. I was unable to hear anything,\nI only was looking and rejoicing at the harmony of this room. I hadn’t seen anything like this before.\n\nThe door made of the same Karelian birch with the blue grip opened upstairs, and a white\ndressed woman was going downstairs.\n\nI was so perplexed when I saw that the woman’s face, her hands and her neck were\nabsolutely black. She went up straight to I., extended both of her black hands towards him and began to\nspeak in English.\n\nUnexpectedly, having seen the black woman for the first time in my life not at the circus, but\nwho was speaking in English, who had excellent manners, who’s figure was like a statue, with the beautiful\nface, fine lips and with plait, not the black felt of the curls on her head – I was simply frightened. My fear\nwasn’t gone even when I. pushed me slightly. My entire inner confusion must have been reflected rather\nclearly in my face, because even I. who usually was restrained gave a laugh, while I hurried to hide myself\nbehind his broad back.\n\nMy heart started beating so strongly, as if I had survived two storms in the sea. And I was\nprepared to withstand at least two more of them, only that if I didn’t have to touch the hand of this black-\nskinned woman.\n\nNow I even don’t know why I was so frightened back then. The truth is, she was rolling the\nwhite of her eyes perfectly, she was speaking with a guttural voice and very quickly, but there was nothing\nrepulsive in her. She was even tender and womanly in her own way, perhaps she was even wonderful.\n\n```\nHowever, I was terror-struck because of her.\n```\nI kept moving backwards, I let both Turks go forward, who, apparently, were familiar with\nher earlier, and I was even shaking out of terror.\n\n\nHaving arranged something with I., the black-skinned woman hurried to the room on the\nright in a light and springy gait. I. turned to me, while I was working by the sweat of my brow and I couldn’t\nsoothe my beating heart. He went up to me laughing, but, having looked at me more attentively, he\nstopped laughing and told me tenderly.\n\n“I should have warned you that you would meet the blacks’ family at Florentian’s friend,\nwhom he saved during his journey across Africa. This woman was still a baby when she together with her\ntwo juvenile brothers and her mother were brought to Russian. She is perfectly educated and very devoted\nto Florentian and Ananda. I didn’t pay attention how your nervous system has suffered during those days of\ntests, and I relied on your strength too much. I beg your pardon for such a lack of understanding, eat this\nsweet and your heart will stop beating.”\n\nI was unable to calm myself still for a long time. I sat down on the chair, I. also gave me some\nwater to drink. I started thinking about Florentian with all my might, so that I wouldn’t faint away as it had\nhappened at Ananda’s.\n\nSoon I got better. I.’s eyes were looking at me with such tenderness, both Turks were trying\nto help me so much that I brought myself to overcome myself once again, I gave a smile and explained to\nthem that the woman with her movements on the stair reminded me of a snake, and I was afraid of the\nsnakes terribly.\n\nThe younger Turk laughed merrily and agreed with me that the snakes were terrible, but he\ndidn’t see anything resembling to the snake in this slender and tall figure.\n\nExactly at this moment the black figure appeared in the doorway once again. With my\nthoughts about Florentian I fenced myself off as with a barrier and now I was already looking at the black-\nskinned woman absolutely calmly.\n\nAnd indeed, one could be frightened only out of surprise. There was nothing ugly in her. On\nthe contrary, with the perfection of her forms and her elegance she reminded more of a statue. Her face\nwas interesting, too, only her big, bulging eyes with flashing whites were affecting my nerves rather\nunpleasantly.\n\nI couldn’t get used to her blackness put into a white batiste in any way. The contrast\nbetween her black skin and the irreproachable whiteness of her clothes in this perfectly bright room in\nwhich my imagination had already tenanted golden-haired angels was oppressing me. With all my might I\nseized Florentian’s hand in my thoughts and once again I understood how I didn’t know life, how I was\nlacking experience and how intemperate I was.\n\n“The enemy is never drowsing and is always trying to take advantage of every moment of\nyour confusion,” – I remembered the words from Ali’s letter.\n\nAll those thoughts didn’t have time to flash across my mind, and the black-skinned girl\nalready went up to I. and told him that the master was asking him to enter his study alone, and he was\noffering to this companions to look round the garden where he and I. would join us in a quarter of a hour.\n\nI. went to the master. He must have known the way. The girl took us to the garden by\nopening the revolving, mirror door which I mistook for an ordinary, mirror set of the walls.\n\nThrough this door we got into the library, from here we went to the veranda and descended\nto the garden.\n\n\nWhat a flower garden was laid out here! How beautiful the range of colours from the flowers\nthat I didn’t know at all was flowing! The birds were chirping, fantastic shadows of the trees were\nstretching on the little walks. Such peace and silence were hanging in this little corner that it was difficult\neven to believe it that the sea was right here, because the murmur wasn’t heard at all. It was also difficult\nto believe in the former storm, in all its terror which we had just experienced, so that we could get into this\npoetical kingdom of undisturbed tranquillity.\n\nAs if during a dream, I could hear how the girl was offering us to look round the garden in\nwhich we could find the plants from all over the world and to admire the almond tree in its belated bloom,\nbut I didn’t want to move, I wanted not only to be silent, but not even hear a man’s voice. I stayed in the\nflower garden, I sat down on a small bench under the flowering pomegranate and I devoted myself to my\nthoughts about Florentian and about his friend whose both house and garden – everything was filled with\nsuch peace and beauty.\n\nI forgot about everything. My thoughts flew me off to the world of the dreams, I was thinking\nabout the happiness of all people, about the possibility for everybody to live according to his own spiritual\nand physical needs. Florentian’s friend wasn’t creating this little corner only for himself, was he? How many\nstorms of hearts, how much discord should calm down in a man’s spirit when he finds himself in this peace\nand harmony. In this place every small board, every blossom was as though saturated with love. It seemed\nto me that I understood how an earthly dwelling of those should look, who loved a man by choosing him\nnot for pleasure, but by seeing in everybody the same man like himself, by trying to give help and comfort\nfor everybody.\n\nIn my thoughts I was creating the external portrait of the master of this house, because it\nseemed to me that I could understand his internal one already. I connected him to an extraordinary beauty\nof Florentian and suddenly I felt a new flow of strength by imagining my friend with white clothes and a\nwhite turban, like I saw him for the first time at Ali’s feast. “My dear Florentian, will I see you again? Oh,\nhow I love you!” I addressed him in my thoughts, from the bottom of my heart and... I heard his voice\nclearly, as though he was speaking straight into my ear: “I’m with you, my friend. Keep calm, spread your\ncalm everywhere and you will meet me soon.”\n\nThe illusion of my hearing was so clear that I stood up and wanted to run towards that voice,\nbut how disappointed and astonished I was when I saw I. in veranda, who was calling me poor Lovushka –\nthe catcher of the crows.\n\nA man with an ordinary, light European suit was standing next to I. The contrast between the\nvoice of my dreams and the one of I.’s, between my idolized Florentian and the master who was standing\nnext to I. was so clear that I couldn’t refrain from laughing at myself. All surprises – and the black-skinned,\nsnake-like woman instead of the angels, and an ordinary man instead of Florentian – everything together\nprovoked only laughter within myself from my own childishness.\n\nI was coming nearer to them, laughing and absolutely not comprehending my indecent\nbehaviour.\n\n```\n“What is entertaining you so much, Lovushka,” I. frowned and asked me.\n```\n“Only my own foolishness, Lolion,” I answered him. “It seems that I will never grow out of my\nchildishness and I won’t be able to take those qualities, the living example of which is next to me. It makes\nme laugh, because I always fall under the illusions of my eyes and ears. It’s always that nasty, tight cap of\nthe dervish, which has done so many troubles for me and even ruined my hearing.”\n\n\n“No, my friend,” the master of the house told me. “If your illusion is leading you towards\nkindness and merry laughter, then you can be at ease about yourself that you will achieve a lot in your life.\nOnly angry people don’t recognize laughter. They are trying to overcome everything with persistence of\ntheir will and that’s why they lose. Those people triumph who are moving forward with love.”\n\nI stopped dead. A whirl of thoughts swept through my brain. What was common between\nthis man and Florentian? Why my heart was overflowed with bliss? I was looking at this man of middle\nheight, with dark, a little curly chestnut-coloured hair, covered with a small cap that looked like a\ntyubeteyka. His charming, blue eyes were looking at me tenderly, with love, although an expression of an\nexceptional power was hiding in them.\n\nNamely this expression of strength, energy and inner power surprised me by calling in my\nmemory Florentian’s reflection and the burning power of Ali’s eyes.\n\nI was moved very much by his pleasant speech and his attention showed to me, which I\nhadn’t yet deserved at all. Unwittingly, I thought for a while that during some time already I was living\namong the strange people who were showing their attention to me, which I hadn’t deserved at all, they\nwere my guardians, they were even saving my life, giving me shelter, food, while I... I hung my head\nunhappily and I thought about my helplessness to help my brother, while tears were already oozing\nthrough my eyelashes.\n\nThe master came down to the garden, he embraced me silently and tenderly and took me to\nthe house. I couldn’t suppress my tears. The pain, helplessness, an unspeakable kindness of the people who\nwere protecting my brother, my respect to them and an absolute inability to perceive that guardianship\nand friendship, the fear of being left alone without them – all of that was breaking my heart so much that\nas soon as we sat down on the sofa, I buried myself in the shoulder of this kind friend and I kept crying\nbitterly.\n\n“You see, my friend, what kind of contrasts are boiling in man’s life. In the most terrible\nmoment of the storm, when death was menacing the whole steamer, you were laughing merrily and by\ndoing so, you surprised and raised the spirit of brave people. Now your great love and devotion to your\nfriend made you laugh, and what’s the result from all of it – you are crying, you are thinking about the\nhorror of solitude and you are distresses about the future that still doesn’t exist. How one can lose that\nwhat doesn’t exist? Did you know that you would be crying now several minutes ago? You lost your\nlaughter, tranquillity and joy only because you lost your loyalty to your friend Florentian whom you would\nlike to accompany you during your entire life. Where’s your cheerfulness? Don’t give in to any doubts. The\nmore energy you will put for chasing away your sad thoughts, the faster and better you will educate\nyourself, while your inner discipline will become your habit, which will be easy and daily. Don’t think that\nwe, your new friends, are supernatural and happy keepers of some secrets. We are the same people like\neverybody else. One can divide people only to those who possess awareness, so they are free from\npassions and prejudices that are oppressing them – therefore, they are kind and joyful, and those who\npossess unawareness, so they are fettered in their passions and prejudices – therefore, they are angry and\ndismal. Learn, my son. There’s only one path in life – that’s the knowledge. The knowledge liberates man,\nand the freer he is, the more important for the universe he becomes, the more meaningful his activity for\nthe universal welfare becomes, the more spacious the atmosphere of his tranquillity becomes, which he’s\nradiating round him. Take this medallion, there’s the portrait of your friend Florentian in it. It’s great that\nyou are so devoted to him. Now you can see yourself that you love your real brother as much as untrue one\nwhom you met just recently. The freer you will become by throwing the commonly adopted, conditional\nunderstanding of love out of yourself, the more real, human love will awake within yourself.”\n\n\nHe gave me rather big, rounded medallion that was hanging on the thin, golden chain. There\nwas a dark sapphire put in its cover.\n\n“Hang it and in the moments of doubts, danger, sadness or bitter reflections, take it into\nyour hands by thinking about your friend Florentian and about me, your new friend, always loyal to you,\nand you will find strength to suppress your tears in all situations of your life. Each rolled down tear is\nweakening man’s strength, while each defeated tear is leading him upstairs onto the new level of strength.\nIt is written here in one of the oldest languages of mankind: “Defeat by loving.”\n\n```\nWhile saying this, he opened the medallion, and I saw a wonderful portrait of Florentian.\n```\nI wanted to thank him, I was feeling a great respect for him, I was full of happiness, but\nsomebody knocked at the door. I hardly had time to hang the medallion, and the words of my gratitude\nremained unvoiced. He must have read the unsaid thoughts in my head, he smiled at me and went to open\nthe door.\n\nAt the doorway I saw the white dress and the black figure, but now this silhouette wasn’t\nfrightening me anymore. A sense of power which I had already experienced several times during these days\ntook hold of me again. It was the sense of rebirth of my whole organism, as though all of a sudden I had\nbecome older, self-confident and restrained.\n\n```\n“Sir Vomi, may your friends come in already?” the girl asked him.\n```\n“Yes, Chava, they may. Here, become acquainted with one more friend of mine. While I’ll be\ntalking to the Turks about the subjects that doesn’t interest him at all, take him to the library and show him\nthe shelves with the works about self-education of the philosophers from all over the world. Let him choose\nanything he wants and put those books into the briefcase for him in memory about yourself,” the master\nwas talking to her with a smile, while his eyes were flashing with such a humour which I used to see in the\neyes of Florentian.\n\n“I will take the young guest to the library and show him the books with pleasure, but\nconcerning the memory about myself, I’m not sure if he remembers me with pleasure. It is difficult for\nEuropeans to tolerate the black skin,” Chava was speaking, smiling with her entire mouth and as though\nlighting up the whole room with the glow of her white teeth.\n\n```\nI was feeling totally ashamed, while sir Vomi, as Chava called my new friend, added, smiling.\n```\n“Here’s the first lesson for you, my friend. Defeat your prejudices for the black skin by\nremembering that the same red blood, like everybody else’s, is flowing under such skin.”\n\nI followed Chava and in the next room I ran into I. and the Turks who were going to sir Vomi’s\nstudy. My appearance must have seemed to be unusual for them, because both Turks looked at me\nsurprised, while I. gave me a smile and passed his hand tenderly over my hair.\n\nChava let them come into the study, closed the door behind them and invited me to come\nwith her. We crossed several rooms which were darkened with the shutters from the sun, came into the\nexcellent hall once again and got into the library through the mirror door which was already familiar to me.\n\nNow I could already examine this room. How wonderful and artistic the surroundings were\nhere! Dark bookcases made of mahogany with big, mirror door stood out nicely in the background of the\nblue carpet. The blue ceiling was decorated with perfectly painted white peacocks, forming a ring and a\nyouth, playing the little pipe to them.\n\n\n“This way,” I heard Chava’s voice. “You’ll have to climb up this ladder a little. On the upper\nshelves of these two bookcases you will find those books which sir Ut-Vomi has recommended to you.”\n\nI thanked her, tried to remember that my friend’s first name was Ut-Vomi and I started\nreading the titles of the books.\n\nUp to now I was thinking that I had read many books while my brother was guiding me and\nthat here I would find at least several titles know to me, but the books were written in all languages of the\nworld, even in Russian, and I didn’t know a single one of them.\n\n“I will leave you here for a while, until I bring the briefcase from above,” Chava told me. “I\nwill try to find such one that would remind you of this day and of sir Ut-Vomi.”\n\nI was left alone. The door of the veranda and all windows were thrown open, and a\nwonderful aroma of the flowers was blowing from the garden. This silence was exceptionally pleasant after\nthe incessant murmur of the sea and the wind. I was tempted to go out to the garden and to have a walk\non the soft grass, but I was afraid of becoming absent-minded and I started looking over the books\ndiligently.\n\nBeing disappointed, I already wanted to pass on to the next bookcase when all of a sudden I\nturned round awkwardly, brushed against something, and two books fell down on the floor. I climbed down\nthe ladder, lifted the books and, having opened the thick, leather cover of one of them, I read the title:\n“Self-discipline and its significance in man’s personal and cosmic life”, author Nikolay T., publishing house\nFirs, London.\n\nI rubbed my eyes and read the title page one more time. I seized the second book with the\nsame leather cover – “Man’s path – the path of liberation. Man – a part of the eternal movement”.\nPublishing house Firs, author Nikolay T.\n\nI stopped doubting that both books were really written by my brother. It was impossible to\ndescribe what this discovery opened within myself, what contradictory feelings surged me up! Who was\nthat brother of mine? Who was educating me? Why was I separated from him? These questions arose to\nLovushka the catcher of the crows; I wasn’t searching for anything anymore, I only sat down on the ladder\nand started reading.\n\nNow I already cannot tell for how long I was reading, but I came to myself after the loud\nlaughter of many voices. I gave a start with unexpectedness and I was so confused that not at once I could\nperceive why I., both Turks, Chava and sir Vomi were standing here, where I was and what was going on\nwith me.\n\n```\nSir Vomi came up to me, embraced me tenderly and whispered.\n```\n```\n“Enjoy your find, but be a gallant and courteous youth to the others”.\n```\n```\nHaving looked at the books and me, I. gave a joyful laugh.\n```\n“Lovushka, now you can see that not only you were hiding your literary talent from your\nbrother, but he also kept his books from you. You found them. Now you must become a writer as soon as\npossible, so that your books would get into your brother’s hands. Then you will get even with him.”\n\n“Well, well! Is captain T. your brother?” Chava gave a shout. “In this case, it will be very\ninteresting for you to read his newest book, there’s even his portrait in it.”\n\n\nShe opened the bookcase on the right wall quickly, moved the ladder up to it, pulled out the\nbook with blue covers and opened it at the portrait of my brother. He looked very real here, only his face\nwas very strict, serious, and a clear expression of renunciation was reflected in it.\n\nI read the title: “Not life is creating man, but man is carrying his life and creating his destiny”.\nTo my shame, I must confess that I didn’t understand anything from these titles. I sighed heavily. I took all\nthree books and went out to the garden where sir Vomi and the rest of his guests were sitting already.\n\nI came up to him and told him sadly that my brother’s books were very dear for my heart,\nbut unfortunately, they seemed to me to be as Chinese script. I asked his permission to take them to\nConstantinople from where I could send them back to him.\n\n“Take them, my friend, and keep them to yourself. I will always be able to replenish my\nlibrary, while it would be difficult for you to acquire them at the moment. Concerning the contents of the\nbooks, now you have such a teacher and master in I.’s personality next to you that he will explain\neverything whatever you won’t understand to you. He will tell you everything about us, too,” the master\nadded in a more silent voice, so the Turks couldn’t hear us, to whom Chava, having taken them a little\nfarther away from us, was telling about the flower beds.\n\n“Don’t be sad so often for your ignorance and intemperance,” sir Vomi continued. He seated\nme on the little bench between I. and himself. “I you want to save your brother’s life, develop your heroic\nfeelings not only for this goal, but live your every, ordinary day in such a way as though it was your last day.\nDon’t leave any reserve of your strength and knowledge for tomorrow, but deliver the completeness of all\nyour thoughts and feelings today, now. Don’t try to develop the power of your will, but live your life in such\na way that during every passing moment you would be simply kind and pure.”\n\nThe Turks and Chava with an excellent, green leather briefcase in her hands approached us.\nShe extended it to me, gave me a mischievous smile and asked me if this green colour didn’t remind me of\nsomeone’s eyes.\n\n```\n“And inside,” she added, “you will find the portrait of sir Vomi.”\n```\nI was moved by such attention of her and I told her that it must have been very well for\neverybody who happened to be next to her because of the warmth of her heart and her tenderness which\nshe was radiating so simply, that I would always remember her obligingness and that it was very sad for\nme, because I was such a poor cavalier and I didn’t have anything to give her in order to remember me.\n\n```\n“And if I find something that belongs to you? Will you sign an autograph for me?”\n```\nI was deprived of speech. Was there my thing in this house? I passed my hand over my\nforehead and checked if I wasn’t sleeping in a heroic Florentian’s sleep. Chava laughed loudly and told me\nin her guttural voice.\n\n```\n“Cavalier Lovushka, I’m waiting for your answer.”\n```\n```\nI was so confused that sir Vomi answered her instead of me.\n```\n“Chava, bring your treasure here if you have it and don’t embarrass the man who still doesn’t\nknow himself that he has given a pearl to the world and clarified the lives of many people.”\n\nI lifted my eyes up to sir Vomi and I was expecting to see the flashes of humour in his face,\nwhich I had seen already, but his face was serious, and he was looking at me affectionately. In my heart I\nfelt the well-known irritation from all these riddles and I was already about to begin to scream when I saw\nChava at the door with the thick magazine in her hands. That was “The news of literature”. Having opened\n\n\nthe magazine, she let me to read the headline of the story – “The first loss – and the light went out”. That\nwas namely my story which fascinated the audience of the student party in Petersburg and some author so\nmuch, and now it was already published and spread across the world. Chava opened the end and showed\nme the signature. “Student T.”\n\n```\n“Well, sign your autograph,” I. told me, “and we already have to get ready for the steamer.”\n```\nI took the pencil out of Chava’s hands, looked at her, gave a laugh and wrote: “The new\nmeeting – and the light began to shine”.\n\n```\nThe whole company was surprised by my autograph no less than the story itself.\n```\n“You still don’t understand yourself what you’ve written in the story and what the words of\nyour autograph mean, my young man of wisdom,” sir Vomi was talking to me, while saying good-bye. “On\nour next meeting you will already have made progress in your path of knowledge, and now go as I. will be\nguiding you, and while being next to him, wait for coming back of Florentian.”\n\nHe embraced me and passed his hand tenderly over my hair. Chava extended both of her\nblack and wonderful hands to me. I bent down and kissed them one after another – these wonderful, black\nhands, - as though asking to forgive her for my fright and disgust which she had stirred within me in the\nbeginning.\n\nI felt how those hands began to tremble. When I raised my head I saw how the expression of\nChava’s face had changed and I heard the whisper.\n\n```\n“I will always be your loyal servant, the light will be travelling from you to me, too.”\n```\n```\nI. separated us when he came up to Chava to say good-bye to her.\n```\nWe left sir Vomi together with the Turks who also wanted to visit their relatives. I was\nsurprised how the time had flown past. It seemed that we had spent only an hour at sir Vomi’s, but it was\nalmost seven o’clock already.\n\nI was happy that the Turks left us, because I didn’t want to talk at all. I. took my arm, we\nturned into some street and called at the bookshop. I. asked them if they had the latest issue of “The news\nof literature”.\n\n```\n“No,” the sales-man answered him, “this time everything was sold out.”\n```\nBut a hoarse voice from another end of the shop told us that they could take the last issue\nfrom the shop window if we were really going to buy it. I. assured them that we would certainly buy it, the\nsales-man took the magazine from the shop window, I put it in the briefcase, we paid and left.\n\n“Oh, how I don’t want to come back to the steamer, Lolion,” I told him. “I would stay here\nforever, in the sir Vomi’s garden.”\n\n“Well, who can trust you! You wanted to stay forever with Florentian, to share your activity\nwith him during your entire life, and now you already want to live in the sir Vomi’s garden,” I. was smiling.\n\n“Yes,” I answered him, “my words may seem like a treason for Florentian, I myself also\ncannot explain well enough to you what is going on in my heart. My heart is like made of rubber, it has\nwidened even more, and now not only my brother and Florentian is living in it. I haven’t yet perceived\ncompletely what all three friends of yours have in common: Ali, Florentian and sir Vomi, but I see within\nthem some higher nobleness, some power that I hadn’t seen up to now. I’m even thinking that you and\nAnanda also have very much in common with these friends. Only I still cannot comprehend why all of you\n\n\nare so utterly compassionate and selfless to me! By helping my brother who, of course, is worthy of every\nkind of assistance and protection, you are doing so much for me, what I really don’t deserve at all. And you,\npersonally you, Lolion, how can I ever repay you?”\n\n“Lovushka, man doesn’t have to wait for a reward and praise for his behaviour in his life,” I.\nanswered me. “Life is only a string of causes and effects; and the entire universe is obeying to this law, not\nonly a man’s life; but we will still have lots of time to talk about such personal subjects. Would you like to\ndo your duty to courtesy now and to buy flowers for our ladies, because they were trying so much and\nhelped us to dress Joan and her children?”\n\n“No, as you have just said, I don’t want to repay for a good work at all. Courtesy? It seems\nthat I’m a poor cavalier, but what I want to do from the bottom of my heart – that’s to bring roses for Joan,\nand I would do it with such a joy that even the coming back to the steamer wouldn’t be so difficult.”\n\n“Great, here’s the flower shop. I will do the duty of courtesy with respect to the Italians, and\nyou give the flowers to Joan, but be careful, Lovushka. You don’t have to see a woman as an object of love\nin any of the women whom we meet now, but only friends whom we must help if we can. Now both in our\nhearts and thoughts we must retain such virtue and purity, as though we were marching to a sacred feat.\nAll of our strength – both spiritual and physical – must be directed purposefully only to that affair which Ali\nand Florentian have entrusted us to do. Be strong and don’t be angry with me. The poor, destroyed Joan’s\nheart, with all its might is ready to attach to that one who will show attention and sympathy to her. Now\nyour goal is not to calm and comfort any woman personally, but to serve loyally to that affair which you’ve\naccepted voluntarily. Now you aren’t allowed to want to save your brother and at the same time to find a\nwoman for yourself.”\n\n“It didn’t even occurred to me to overstep the limits of the most ordinary friendship in my\nbehaviour with Joan. I’m very sorry for her and I want to help her from the bottom of my heart. Lolion,\nbelieve me, neither she nor Chava could ever become the heroines of my romance... If you have any\ndoubts, I agree to hand the flowers to signoras Galdoni, and you give my flowers to Joan from both of us.”\n\nWe called at the flower shop, at the window of which we have already been standing for a\nwhile, talking.\n\nI picked out white and red roses for Joan, put them on a leaf of a palm and, having tied\neverything up with a white and red ribbon, I made a bouquet. There were two bouquets in the hands of I.\nalready – one of them was made of reddish, another one of yellow roses.\n\nTo his question why I’d chosen such colours of the roses and ribbons, I answered him that I\ndidn’t know any meaning of colours at all, but the presents which were sent to me from Ali before the feast\nwere of white colours – the one of power, and of red colour – the one of love.\n\n“Now, in my turn, I want to send the greetings of love and power to Joan, and I hope that she\nwon’t feel anything objectionable here.”\n\nWe went out onto the embankment by bringing the flowers. All of a sudden, the hooter of\nour steamer was heard, and although we still didn’t have to hurry, we quickened our step anyway.\n\nHaving climbed up to the first class, we separated: I. went to Joan, while I turned to the\nItalian’s cabin and handed the reddish roses to the daughter, and the yellow ones to her mother. The girl\naccepted the flowers with joy, and a light flush flooded her face and neck.\n\n\nHer mother gave a tender smile and asked me if I had already seen madam Joan with the\nnew clothes. I answered her that my brother went there, because the children needed his help, and I would\nsee all of them at once tomorrow.\n\nI was feeling full of new, unexpected impressions, the briefcase with my brother’s books was\npulling me back to the cabin, so that I alone could quietly inspect my brother’s portrait as soon as possible,\nbut in the meanwhile I had to stand among the crowd of smartened up ladies and cavaliers and to keep up\nan easy, saloon conversation.\n\nHaving taken an advantage of the first occasion, maybe even showing myself not at all polite,\nI went onto the deck.\n\nI already wanted to go to take a shower, then to lie down peacefully for a while and to\nreflect, but it seemed that today I wasn’t destined to be alone. I didn’t even have time to take off my jacket\nwhen my nurse – clumsy sailor came in and delivered a small parcel and a letter in a very elegant, long\nenvelope to me. He was very interested in my trip to the shore, he complained that he wasn’t allowed to\ncome with me, and he must had been of use to me. To his question about our dinner, I answered him that\nwe would sit down at the table when we put out to sea.\n\nI could hardly get rid of this man, then the Turks came. I hardly had time to hide the parcel\nand the letter. The Turks told me how joyfully they spent their time at their relatives where they found out\nabout the consequences of the storm. It turns out that only our ship had overcome this element\nsuccessfully. Two steamers cast off after us from Sevastopol. One of them was an old Greek steamer and a\nFrench one that decided to sail when the storm had already started. Both of them perished. The storm is\nstill raging in Sevastopol, although with less power already.\n\nThey heard about our ship from the chief mechanic himself that it had to be repaired\nseriously in Constantinople and that it would stay there for quite a long time.\n\nI was trying to be polite and restrained with all my might, but the irritation was already\npoking at me from inside, because I was unable to live my life as I wanted to, because I was chained with\nthe rules of conduct that were accepted in society.\n\n“Have really all the people whom I met during these days and who surprised me with their\ngreat self-control, as well as I. with whom I was travelling, acquired their excellent politeness and\nendurance in such a difficult way like I did?”\n\nI was already about to cry out at the Turks and to tell them to leave me alone, I could hardly\ncontrol myself already when I heard the voices of I. and the captain on the stairs of our deck.\n\nI.’s face stunned me. I hadn’t yet seen him such radiant, as though some light was burning\ninside of him – it seemed that he all was radiating with joy.\n\nA whirl of thoughts blew over my head one more time. Among those thoughts there were\nsome of them that were bad and disgraceful. I thought for a while that I. lingered at Joan for quite a long\ntime and he was radiating, because he loved her, while he was telling me that at the moment we couldn’t\nhave any personal feelings. Both envy and a retrograde thought about my dependency on the man whom I\nhardly knew flashed in my head. A protest against such a state of mine and a great irritation arose within\nmyself.\n\nI almost couldn’t hear who was talking around me and what they were talking about. I\nlooked at I. one more time and I felt ashamed of such unkind feelings of mine. I.’s face kept radiating his\ninner fire, while his eyes were shining, reminding me of the Ananda’s stars.\n\n\n“No,” I told to myself, “this man cannot be a hypocrite. Since he’s radiating like this, then his\nthoughts also have to burn with honesty and love, otherwise from where that light could start, which is\ngiving out warmth to everybody and which has melted even such a mirage in which I had just been mixed\nup.”\n\nIn my thoughts I was already flying into the memories what I. had told me about himself,\nwhat I had experienced and seen while being next to him during that short time, I also was flying to that\nextraordinary man to whom he introduced me in B.\n\nBit by bit the surroundings stopped irritating me, I forgot everything, turned into Lovushka –\nthe catcher of the crows, I moved into the sir Vomi’s garden and immersed in my thoughts about him so\nmuch that as though I could hear his voice.\n\n“Be strong, your childhood is over already. Learn to live not only for your brother, but take a\ngood look at everybody whom you meet. If you met a man and failed to find a word of comfort for him –\nyou lost a moment of happiness in your life. Don’t think about yourself, while you are talking to people, but\nthink only about them, then you will neither get tired nor irritated.”\n\nI gave a start with a terrible roar, I gave a jump from the sound that hit my ears, I was\nconfused of everyone’s joint laughter and I couldn’t grasp at all where I was, until I finally understood that\nit was the ship’s hooter roaring.\n\nI. put his arms round my shoulders tenderly and told me that my nerves got totally loose\nduring these days.\n\n```\n“Yes, Lolion, they got totally loose.”\n```\nI already wanted to tell him about one more hallucination of my hearing, but he just put his\nfinger at his lips unnoticed and whispered to me: “Later,” surprising me a great deal by doing so.\n\nThe hooter died away, there was a sense of a racket in the steamer, as always before casting\noff. We separated from the pier slowly. The band of water between B. and the steamer was widening, and\nfinally the shore passed out of sight. One more page of my life was closed, one more bright picture entered\nfirmly into my heart, and once again I didn’t notice what an important place it took there.\n\n\n# Chapter 15\n\n## We are sailing to Constantinople\n\nAfter some time the clumsy sailor showed up. He was bringing a collapsible table and a\ntablecloth, and the man-servant with the plates and the set of table tools was following him.\n\nThe Turks remembered that they still had to change their clothes before taking their seats at\nthe table d’hote, and they hurried downstairs.\n\nOnce they left, it became easier for me instantly. I.’s harmonious atmosphere embraced me\nlike the pure air of the mountains. All trifles, my irritation, thoughts and feelings which were leading me to\nhopeless, personal suffering as though came off me. An interest in his inner world rose to the first plan, a\nwish to understand the cause of this extraordinary radiance of his. Unwittingly, I yielded to the charms of\nhis tranquillity and even to some grandeur of his mood. In my thoughts I came back to his childhood, to his\nsuffering and I was reflecting upon that power which he’d achieved now.\n\nI was sitting next to him in silence and only now, for the first time I noticed that the whole\nouter noise wasn’t disturbing me, that as though I wasn’t noticing people by seeing them clearly with my\neyes.\n\nI didn’t turn into Lovushka – the catcher of the crows, I perceived where I was and I even\nexchanged a few words with the captain; although everything inside of me was as though buzzing – I was\ncalm. I had never experienced such tranquillity and perception that all of it inside of me was because of\nthat inner harmony which Lolion who kept smiling was spreading around himself.\n\n“Here’s how man can be with his inner state. Here’s where the power of help for people is,\nwithout any words, any sermons, only by his own living example,” I was thinking to myself.\n\nEven my impatience to find out from whom I received the parcel and the letter stopped; I\nbegan to think about the letter that I received from Florentian. Only now his words that I had to go to India\nreached me. I was interested in this country for a long time already, maybe because I had read many books\nabout it at my brother’s and seen many illustrations, but now when I met such people like Ali, when I found\nout from I. that all of them, including sir Vomi, were living in India, my interest in it came to life again. I\nwanted to see that country myself. My fear and protest against the East settled down a little. I began to\nperceive the separation with my brother from a new angle, it wasn’t only a tragedy for me anymore, but it\nwas also the beginning of my endurance.\n\nWe finished our dinner. Unfortunately, I had to ask I. for his help instantly, to take his drops,\nbecause there still was a strong tossing in the open sea, and I was unable to feel strongly. As the captain\nhad foreseen, the echoes of the storm continued, only now this somehow was affecting me very strongly.\n\n“I can see for a long time already that you want to tell me about your impressions from the\nstoppage at B. I also have some news for you,” I. was talking to me.\n\n“First of all, I want to find out from whom I received the parcel and the letter, and to share\nits contents with you,” I answered him.\n\n\nA derisive smile slipped across I.’s face, he stood up and offered me to come back to our\ncabin. I pulled the letter and the parcel from under my pillow. The signature “Chava” which I read first of all\nsurprised me most.\n\nI was so surprised that instead of reading the letter, I extended it to I. I was thinking that the\nimage of the black statue with the white dress only flashed like a butterfly and disappeared, but now it\ncame to life again and affected me rather unpleasantly.\n\nI. took the letter, looked at me with his shinning eyes and started reading it loudly.\n\n_“I don’t know in which words to address you. If I was a white-skinned woman, I would know\nhow to evade the conditional rules of conduct of the society, which were formed by the prejudices of ages,\nbut my black skin doesn’t admit me even to the rules of politeness and conduct, which the white people are\nmostly applying only to themselves. I can address you only like that eternal, little part of light, which is living\nin every man and which doesn’t depend on the place, time, nationality or religion. Only knowledge dispels\nall prejudices and opinions which are rammed into people’s heads. Therefore, by addressing your love, I\ndare to say “Friend” to you._\n\n_So, Friend, - for the first time in my life, a white man showed his politeness and compassion to\nme by pressing my black hands to his lips. If I were to live for thousand years more, I wouldn’t forget these\nkisses, because my heart responded with a kiss to them. Perhaps love, about which women are talking and\nexpressing it with their actions, has many forms, but for me only one form of it is accessible – that’s a\nlimitless selflessness, not demanding anything in return to oneself. I give my entire heart to you, which\ndoesn’t know any doubts, and I will follow you faithfully wherever you may go, it doesn’t matter if it would\nbe a heaven or hell, fire or water, a success or failure. It is clear to me why I must live exactly so and what\neternal laws are binding us to together. One day in the future, it will be clear to you as well, but now I will\npass them over in silence. I understand what you may think of such an attachment of mine to you, which\nnow is so unnecessary and limiting to you, but the time will come, you will choose a friend of life for yourself\nand then you will need the black nurse for your white-skinned children very much. My devotion that I’m\noffering to you now is simple, easy and joyful, if we look at it from the position of conditionalities. If a\nthought could rise to the spaces of the movement of the entire universe and would catch a free note of love\nover there, of love which isn’t oppressed by the illusionary understanding of the daily routine that it is a test,\na duty and a desire to acquire as much as possible personal wealth, then we could see there not the grey\ndaily routine oppressed by sadness or heartbreak, but a happy opportunity to pour love from our hearts –\nfree, pure, unselfish love – and that is exactly what the true human happiness is. And let life forgive my\ncertitude, but I know that I will find my quiet harbour in your home by educating your children. I know how\nmy black skin frightened you, so I appreciate the nobleness of your heart even more, which has sent a kiss to\nmy hands. Wishing to remind you not of my blackness, but only of our meeting, I’m sending a small box to\nyou, which I hope you will like. Accept it as the greatest present of my devotion. Sir Vomi gave it to me on\nthe occasion of my majority. He explained to me that I had to give it to that person for whom I would be\nready to die. I’ve already told you – my path is after you. In order to not show myself to be sentimental, I\nfinish my letter by bowing low before your friend I., your brother and your great friend Florentian._\n\n```\nYour servant Chava“\n```\n\nI. had already read the letter long time ago, while I was still sitting with my head put on my\nhands and I didn’t know what I should think about this unexpected coincidence, too.\n\n“There are no coincidences,” I heard my friend’s voice. “Everything what we encounter\nobeys to the law of the causality, and there’s no effect in life without a cause. The more man liberates from\nthe prejudices, the more he may know. Chava is right when she writes that knowledge dispels all prejudices\nand opinions rammed in one’s head. We will still have lots of time and we will be able to talk about all of it.\nI can tell you that the sarths who were following us died during the storm in the old Greek ship. Their\nhatred forced them to board the ship, although they knew about the upcoming storm. Now we are free\nfrom any persecutors until we reach Constantinople, and there we will find out what happens next. Maybe\nyou shoot a glance at such a sacred Chava’s present, because the tossing increases, and we certainly need\nto make the round of the whole steamer. The people are much more sensitive to the tossing after the\nexperienced storm. First of all, we have to visit Joan, then Italians and so on...”\n\nIn unwrapped the small Chava’s parcel and I took a small dark blue square box out of the\nleather case. On its cover, on the oval made of enamel I saw the portrait of sir Vomi, which was set in a\nframe of small, but nicely shinning brilliants, and instead of a lock, there was a large, prominent, dark\nsapphire fixed.\n\n“During my entire life I hadn’t seen so many precious things as lately when I was able to hold\nthem in my hands,” I said, while being lost in thought.\n\n“Yes,” I. answered me. “So many people would like at least to hold the portrait of sir Vomi in\ntheir hands, not only to receive it as the present, but hide everything in the travelling-bag, it is time for us\nto move already.”\n\nAs I was told, I put all the things and books in the travelling-bag, I. took the first-aid kits. We\ndidn’t even have time to put the first-aid kits on our shoulders, and the clumsy sailor already came\nhurriedly to us. This time he came as a messenger of the captain with the request for us to hurry to the\nhospital’s cabin No. 1A, where the children and their mother were very ill.\n\nWe dashed away to via the nearest way, while my nurse clumsy sailor saved both my nose\nand my ribs from breaking many times, because once again I was unable to keep my balance. To my\nquestion if the new storm wasn’t starting, I. answered me that nature couldn’t rage so much two times in a\nrow, while the clumsy sailor was laughing and he stated that it was only the ripples of the sea surface.\nMaybe it was only the ripples, but I must admit that it was a very nasty ripple.\n\nHaving entered the Joan’s cabin, we found almost the same scene of despair once again, like\nthe first time. The mother was sitting on the sofa, squeezed herself into the corner of it. Both of her\nchildren were in her arms. An absolute confusion was reflected on her face.\n\nWhen I. bent down and wanted to take the girl from her, so he could put her in the bed, Joan\nseized his hands and she was shouting that the girl was dying and that she didn’t want to let her die on the\ncold bed, let her rather die at her mother’s heart. She seized I.’s hands so strongly that if I hadn’t rushed to\nthe boy, he would have rolled down from her knees onto the floor.\n\nHaving taken the boy in my arms, I was already going to give a shout and reproach the\nmother for such behaviour of her, but... sir Vomi’s reflection which had entered my heart firmly helped me\nto control myself, and I told her tenderly.\n\n“So here’s how you are keeping your promise to take care of your children selflessly. Is it\nmore convenient for them to be on your knees and not in their beds?”\n\n\nJoan was crying. She said to me that she didn’t see me for so long time that she lost her self-\ncontrol, while the children’s illness was breaking her heart. It turned out that, according to her, I had\nabsolutely forgotten her. I reproached her that both I. and the Italians visited her, that I sent the flowers\nand books to her, only that she shouldn’t think that my presence or absence could have any influence to\nher children’s health.\n\n“I’m still so young and I know so little, I need an all-round education and guardianship\nmyself,” I continued my thought, “that if not my brother I., then I would have died ten times already. You\nmust stop being sad. Don’t think how lonesome you are, you’d rather help the doctor to give your children\nthe medicine to drink.”\n\nI don’t know very well myself what I was talking to poor Joan, but the intonation of my voice\nmust have rendered the entire tenderness of my compassion to her. She wiped her tears instantly and...\nnobody could have found a better nurse.\n\n```\nI. was delayed by the girl for quite a long time, because she was terribly sickly.\n```\n“Today she will feel so bad for several hours more, but tomorrow she will really start\nrecovering,” I. was explaining to Joan. “Tomorrow let her stay in the bed during the entire day. If there’s no\ntossing, take her on the deck, and your little boy will ask you for something to eat in an hour already.”\n\n```\nWe were already going to leave, but Joan addressed I. pleadingly.\n```\n“Let your brother stay with me. I’m always afraid of something, a new disaster appears to me\nall the time, also it always seems to me that my children will die.”\n\nI. nodded his head. He told me to stay here, until the clumsy sailor comes. Only if anyone\ncalled for a doctor, I would have to explain to him that I. was the doctor, while I could help only while being\nnext to him, that I was helpless alone.\n\nI. left us. I was left alone with Joan next to the little beds of the children. The girl was calming\nlittle by little, her breathing was becoming even, her suffocation stopped. Joan kept silent, she didn’t cry,\nbut I saw that not only her girl’s illness was to blame for this new attack of her despair.\n\n```\n“What has happened,” I asked her, “that you are like this again?”\n```\n“I don’t know myself why all those terrible memories and the images of my husband’s death\nrushed into my memory. I felt such fear of the future... I cannot even describe to you what dreadful dear\nseizes me when I’m thinking that we will arrive to Constantinople and I will have to part with you and your\nbrother. I will die of loneliness and hunger.”\n\n“You will die of loneliness and hunger? And your children will outlive you? Who is going to\nwork for their sake? Do they have anyone closer to them than you? You are thinking about what has\nhappened and what will happen. And how about now? Aren’t you thinking about that moment when you\nalmost dropped your boy and that you harmed your daughter by keeping her not in the bed? Up to now I,\njust like you, also was always thinking about that what had happened and what would happen. One of my\nbeloved and wise friends, as well as my current brother in arms I., showed me with their examples that one\nmust live only with that what is happening now, and that the most important thing is namely that “now”.\nYou, too, try not to cry, but to nurse your children cheerfully. Your tears are disturbing their peaceful sleep,\nand they will be sick for a long time. Give them your smile, and their health will improve faster. As far as\nConstantinople is concerned, I. told you that he would help you to settle, and his words never differ from\nhis deeds. If your goal is to help your children to rise to their feet, then why you should think if you are\nalone? You know from your own experience already how everything is unsteady in life. Don’t think about\n\n\nthat what will happen, but think about and ask I. to teach you how you could start educating your children.\nAs far as I am concerned, I cannot help you in any way. I don’t have neither my own family nor home\nmyself, I still cannot earn my bred, because I don’t possess neither knowledge nor talents to do something.\nI am sure that I. would help you.”\n\n“I’m afraid of him very much and I feel shy,” the poor woman answered me, “but I’m not\nafraid of you and I’m very glad to be with you.”\n\n“This is because I am the same child without any experience like yourself, but if you could\ntake a better look at I., you would rejoice at every moment that you are spending next to him.”\n\n“You’ve just told me that mother’s smile could help her children. I’m trying not to cry, but it\nis so difficult. I don’t think that I. could teach me how to educate my children. He’s so strict, he never\nsmiles. Being next to him, I feel like being in an iron cage, and while being next to you, I feel easy and well.”\n\n“It is easy for you to be with me, only because I’m the same light-minded person like\nyourself. You’d better concentrate and think for a while what great energy you could give to your children if\nyou really loved them! Then not the tears would be flowing from your eyes, but the whole flows of energy.\nYou are crying for yourself, right? And you have to think how to protect your children.”\n\n“I still cannot understand you,” Joan began to speak very silently after a long consideration,\n“but it becomes clear to me that I’m really thinking too much about myself. I will try to delve deeply into\nyour words, perhaps they will help me to live differently.”\n\nI was truly sorry for the poor woman. I was trying not to cross the limits of our friendly\nconversation and not to pass to the tone of an educator. Joan was simply changing in front of my eyes. That\nsmile which was always shining in her young face when I used to be next to her wasn’t already playing on it,\nbut her disappointment was gone, too. Her sadness, a strict resolution – as though all of a sudden she had\nbecome older than me – separated her from me with the ring in which she retired into herself.\n\nWe were sitting next to the little beds of her children silently, and my thoughts came back to\nChava. What a strong and brave woman she seemed to be for me now! And how her black hand of\nassistance would be needed for this fragile and delicate mother now!\n\n“Don’t think that I’m weak and I’m afraid of word,” all of a sudden the trembling voice of\nJoan sent me back from the world of the dreams. “No, no, I’m not afraid of work. Simply I loved my\nhusband too much and this loss mixed my love to him and my tears for him with my love for my children\nand with my fear for them. I feel that I begin to grasp that fear is draining my energy, it is leading me to\ndisappointment, and with that I harm my children. Only now it becomes clearer to me to what a horrible\nlife I will doom myself if I don’t find the courage and strength to live only for my children, to be their\nprotection, if I am only mourning over my sad destiny of the woman who has lost her husband.”\n\nThere came a knock at the door. The radiating clumsy sailor entered and told me that I. was\ninviting me to come to the first class where the Italian fell ill again. I said good-bye to Joan and I felt that as\nthough with my words I had hurt and disappointed her. Her hand-shake was sincere, but her face remained\nstrict.\n\nI found I. in the cabin of signoras Galdoni, where the mother had burst into tears, while her\ndaughter was lying like a corpse.\n\n“This is namely that difficult case about which I was telling you still for the first time. Such\nfaint of the organism will happen after every strong excitement, until signora Maria learns to control\nherself perfectly,” I. addressed me.\n\n\n“No, no, I didn’t tell her anything special,” signora Giovana was irritated and she was\nspeaking loudly in a raised voice. “I only wanted to warn her about the new disaster. One misfortune was\nalready enough for us.”\n\n“Why are you trying to turn your neighbours’ attention by speaking loudly?” I. told her\nsilently. “Now we need to help your daughter to recover her consciousness, right? It isn’t so easy to do\nthat. If you keep screaming like this, my efforts may be of no use at all. If you cannot find so much love in\nyour heart that you would be thinking about your daughter’s life and concentrate all your strength to help\nher instead of thinking about your experiences, then leave the cabin. All egoistic thoughts and irritation is\nonly hindering in the moment of danger.”\n\n“Doctor, please forgive the eclipse of my mind. I will be praying for her from the bottom of\nmy heart,” the mother was speaking to I. by trying to hold back her tears.\n\n“Then forget yourself, think only about her and stop crying. One is always crying only for\noneself,” I. answered her.\n\nLike the first time, he asked me to lift the girl a little and, having opened her mouth, to give\nher the medicine to drink. He injected one more medicine, and both of us started doing the artificial\nventilation to her.\n\nAll our efforts were unsuccessful. Then he strewn some bitterly smelling powder on the\npaper, rolled a tip from it, set it on fire and put it to the very nose of the girl. Having inhaled, she gave a\nstart, sneezed, expectorated, opened her eyes and fainted away again.\n\nThen I. besprinkled her face with water, put a hot warmer at her neck and set the herbs on\nfire again. She gave a start again, uttered a groan and opened her eyes. With my help I. seated her up and,\nwhile holding the burning herbs close to her face, he told her.\n\n```\n“Breathe with your mouth and as deeply as possible.”\n```\nI was holding the girl over her shoulders and I felt how her entire body was starting with\nevery deep inhalation.\n\nWe couldn’t step aside from her still for a long time. Only when she had already recovered\ncompletely, I. ordered to give her some warm milk to drink, he forbid her to talk at all and covered her with\na warm blanket. He explained to her mother that the storm wouldn’t happen again for certain, and that the\nsea would subside completely in a couple of hours.\n\nWe went out on the deck where the whole crowd of people was waiting for us. The unhappy\nhusband of the vixen duchess was standing in front of the crowd. The youth seemed to be very grief-\nstricken. A dark blue bruise was visible on his left cheek, his right eye was all swollen and with a bruise, too,\nas though he had participated in a fight.\n\nHis appearance was so deplorable that even the funny contrast between his elegant suit and\nhis crooked, coloured physiognomy wasn’t making us laugh, while his only pleading eye was telling about\nthe vast tragedy experienced by this man.\n\n“Doctor,” he addressed I. with his trembling and weak voice. “Be pitiful. To tell you the truth,\nI’m not to blame for my wife’s escapades. The ship’s doctor refuses to visit us by excusing himself of the\ngreat amount of patients. He is thinking that the duchess is partially pretending and is unwell out of fear,\nbut I can assure you that she’s really dying. I had never seen her like this. She can neither scream nor rage\n\n\nanymore. She’s very very old. Be pitiful,” he was mumbling. “It will be a terrible drama for myself and\nothers if I fail to bring her to Constantinople...”\n\nI. was looking at this unfortunate man in silence, while the ruined life, sold for money to the\ndisgusting old woman, drifted past my eyes. I don’t know what I would have done myself, but I. told him\nsilently.\n\n```\n“Take us to her cabin!”\n```\n```\n“Oh, thank you,” the duchess’ husband uttered, and we followed him to the cabin No. 25.\n```\n“I will be back soon,” I. was speaking to the people who had surrounded him from all sides. “I\nwill examine everybody who needs my help. Don’t follow us, but wait for me here.”\n\nHaving entered the cabin, we saw a really horrible scene. In the hopeless mess we discerned\nan ugly, repulsive, grey, not breathing creature with the toothless, protruded jaw, who was lying on the bed\nand who now didn’t remind of anything the raging, fat old woman with red-haired wig, making a racket in\nthe corridor of the hospital.\n\nI. went up to the bed, touched the hand, forehead and neck of the old woman who looked\nmore like a corpse and directed his look at her husband whose only eye was showing all his fear while\nwaiting for I.’s verdict.\n\n“Your wife is alive,” finally he told him, “but we already cannot expect anymore that she will\nfully recover. She’s half-finished by the paralysis and she will be unable to move anymore, and as far as her\nspeaking and hands are concerned, I will be able to tell you only when I bring her to her senses, and you do\nall my prescribed procedures.”\n\n“I’m determined to nurse her with all my might, only that her life wouldn’t die out and she\nwould make it to Constantinople. She must meet her son, my cousin, there. Let happen what has to happen\nthere, only that nobody would suspect me that I have done away with her on our way,” the man was\nspeaking so, and began to cry bitterly like a little child.\n\nNow it is difficult to say, which feelings were stronger within me back then: a contempt for\nthe man who radiates health, but has acquired the title, because he didn’t want to work, or a compassion\nfor the man who has lost his way to comprehension what a value an independent activity was.\n\nIf lately I hadn’t been living among the people of such high moral like Florentian and I., I\nprobably would only turn away rudely from the duke who was exciting disgust. However, now there wasn’t\nany place left for condemnation in my heart anymore, I only felt my helplessness to help him once again.\n\n```\n“Be strong, my friend,” I heard I.’s voice.\n```\nThe duke raised his face which was wet because of the tears and answered I. in a strong\nvoice which I didn’t expect from him.\n\n“Oh, doctor, doctor! How much horror I had to endure during these three years! How much\nshame and suffering of humiliation I had to bear for that reckless mistake of mine. This life of an idler has\nexhausted me more than any suffering. Only save her life. I will hand her to her son from hand to hand and\nI will start working. I will try to retrieve the respect of honest people with my new life, which I have lost\nnow, it doesn’t matter if I had to become a beggar because of it.”\n\n```\nAnd he covered his disfigured face with his hands again.\n```\n\n“Be strong,” I. repeated one more time. “It is never too late to start a new life and to earn\nyour bred. You don’t even have to go begging, we will help you to find a job if you want it, but I think that at\nthe moment you must stay by your wife. She knows about your honesty and she doesn’t trust anyone\nexcept you, but she didn’t tell the truth even to you about how fabulously wealthy she was. Now, without\nher legs, and maybe without her hands, she won’t agree to stay without you even for a moment. She trusts\nonly you. First of all, do your duty of the husband and the executor of the testament, and then already start\nyour new life. And if you want to work, I will explain to you where and how to find me.”\n\nI. took the syringe out of the first-aid kit, he was drawing the medicine from several little\nbottles for a long time and injected it in four times to both of her legs and hands. Besides, he told me to lift\nher ugly and terrible head a little and poured some bitterly smelling and colourless drops into each of her\nnostrils.\n\nIn the beginning it seemed as though the medicine wasn’t working, but after some ten\nminutes a groan slipped out of her opened mouth. Then we started doing the artificial ventilation to her.\n\nWe had to work for a long time. The sweat was simply streaming. The duke didn’t have any\nstrength to watch this cruel gymnastics of the dying body; he turned away, sat down and began to cry\nbitterly.\n\nAll of a sudden, the old woman opened her eyes, gave a sigh and had a fit of coughing. I.\ndidn’t step back from her, he told me to lift her head and to give her a part of Ali’s pill to drink urgently. I\nfulfilled this instruction of his. I. put the duchess’ hands on the warmer, he covered her with the blanket\nand told us to bring some warmed up red wine. After some time consciousness flashed in the old woman’s\neyes.\n\n```\n“Do you hear me?” I. asked her.\n```\nOnly a moo was heard instead of her answer. Having poured some warmed up wine into her\nmouth, I. gave her the remaining part of Ali’s pill to drink.\n\n“Stop worrying. Not only you will take your wife to Constantinople, but you will also get tired\nof her a great deal over there. She won’t be able to move her legs anymore for sure, but I guess that her\nright hand and her speaking will recover,” I. was explaining to the duke. “Here’s the medicine for you. Now\nshe will be sleeping for good three hours. Then give her these three medicine in turn every half an hour,\nvery accurately. In the evening, before the sleep, I will still call at you.”\n\nWe said good-bye to the duke and came back to the passengers from the first class, who\nwere waiting for us impatiently, because there was quite a lot of time gone by. A Greek boy was waiting for\nus most of all. Having seized I.’s hand, he was sputtering his words, and I could only understand that he was\nfeeling well, the medicine had helped him, but his mother and his grandfather were very weak.\n\nWe found his grandfather really weak in the Greek’s cabin, while his daughter was very\nexcited by his bed.\n\nIt was becoming clearer through her crying that she was obsessed by fear of death. When I.\naddressed the young woman, his voice was breathing of undisturbed calm, compassion and kindness.\n\n“Is it really so difficult for you to understand that your excitement, your fear for your father\nprevents him from being healthy. He’s not a patient, he’s only tired, very tired, because he gave all strength\nfor nursing you. How are you paying back to him now? You are only disturbing his rest with your tears and\nmoaning. Control yourself, in truth all three of you are physically healthy now, only your spirit is ill. Instead\nof rejoicing, you are destroying all my efforts of love and energy with your sadness and fear. With my\n\n\nefforts I show the way to your recovery. Leave your father in peace. Let him sleep, while you and your son\ncould go out onto the deck, take a walk, concentrate and reflect about all last events of your life, which\nseemed to you like a Gordian knot, and thank life for their happy outcome.”\n\nAn unusual astonishment showed up in the Greek’s face. It seemed to me that I. was reading\nin her spirit like in an opened book. She was standing like a statue, she was growing red and pale, while her\nlook was simply fastened to I.’s face.\n\nNot uttering a single word anymore, I. gave the grandfather the medicine to drink. He turned\nhim on another side, with his face to the wall, and we left. I turned around on the threshold – the Greek\nkept standing, motionless.\n\nWe visited several more patients, dropped in at Joan’s where everything was all right and\ncame back to our cabin.\n\nHere I. told me to take out the round leather box with bandages from the Florentian’s\ntravelling-bag. Having taken some ointment and liquid, too, we climbed down to the Turk’s cabin where we\nfound the younger Turk who was lying on the bed. He was page and he must have been suffering a lot.\n\n“Your behaviour is unwise, Ibrahim. Why are you hiding the pain of your leg from your\nfather? You risk to become lame by doing so. I’ve been watching your walk and I think that the bone would\nbe either split or even broken. It’s the real madness to be afraid of upsetting your father!”\n\nHaving examined the leg with the big bruise, I. put the plaster bandage on it and forbad\nIbrahim to walk. He told me to find his father in the billiards-room and to tell him that his son was lying\nwith the broken leg which has been already bandaged and put in plaster.\n\nI found the older Turk with much difficulty. It turned out that there were even several\nbilliards-rooms. He was playing in the second class, he was merry and he was routing all of his opponents.\n\nWhen I entered, exactly at that time he had won the new game against the doctor who was\nconsidered to be the champion of England. There was no limit to the Turk’s joy. His eyes were shining with\njoy, and he was happy with his victory like a child. It seemed that for him the whole world had concentrated\nin the billiard stick and the balls.\n\n```\nHowever, as soon as he saw me, his entire joviality was gone in a flash.\n```\n```\n“Has something happened?” he asked me, worried.\n```\n“Nothing special,” I uttered him by trying to put an untroubled face. “I. sent me to you,\nbecause neither him, nor I are able to sit next to your son at the moment...”\n\nI couldn’t even finish the sentence. The Turk threw the stick, ran from the billiards-room like\na deer, and through several steps he was already leaping to the top.\n\nI hardly had any time to shout to the clumsy sailor who was accompanying me: “Hold him!”\nSadness squeezed my heart – once again I failed to fulfil the task that was entrusted to me.\n\nWhen I. was sending me to Ibrahim’s father, he reminded me of his mad love to his son. He\ntold me to try to predispose him against his son’s illness and to send him to the cabin only then when he\nwas able to look at his lying son calmly and not to disturb the patient’s peace with his cries. Although I\nunderstood everything well, but it turned out that my understanding was only theoretical, while in practice\nI proved to be helpless to influence a man’s heart and to pour a little peace into it.\n\n\nI was running upstairs, too, but no matter how I was hurrying, I reached the top only when\nthe clumsy sailor who heard my request blocked the way for the Turk with his extended hands and spread\nlegs.\n\nThe scandal was already guaranteed: the Turk looked like a furious bull and he was ready to\nattack the clumsy sailor. Ibrahim’s father changed very much – his face became pale, his eyes opened wide,\nhis lips were trembling. He raised his fists and was so dreadful that I almost turned into Lovushka the\ncatcher of the crows. It seemed already that I got confused, but suddenly, as though pushed by some\npower, I rushed through the Turk’s armpit, leaped one step up and turned my face to him... At the same\nmoment, his fist that was as heavy as the hammer landed upon my hand and in this way it protected the\nclumsy sailor’s solar plexus where the deadly Turk’s blow was aimed. This blow was strong, but it reach my\nhead already weakened by someone’s hand which seized the Turk’s fist in the last moment.\n\nHaving taken a look at the man who was fighting against the furious Turk, I recognized my\nrescuer – that was the captain. He was already prepared to give a whistle and to summon his crew, so that\nthey would tie the furious man up when I. seized the Turk with his strong hands and told him only a couple\nof words silently, but clearly and insistently in the language that I didn’t know.\n\nAs if struck by the lightening, the Turk hung his head and hands. His face grew deadly pale,\nand two by tears rolled down his cheeks.\n\nHaving turned to the captain, with the entire politeness and tact that was characteristic to\nhim, I. was sincerely asking his pardon for such an attack of fury of his friend Turk. He was explaining to him\nthat this paroxysm was summoned by his care for his son who was really seriously ill, but his father\nimagined that his son was dead and that he wasn’t allowed to approach his corpse, so he lost his head\ncompletely.\n\n“I can understand that an ill-mannered person’s untameable temperament can disturb his\nequilibrium, but to start a fight against a child – that’s the limit behind which the grown-up man must be\njudged like a criminal,” the captain answered with an absolutely calm and sonorous voice, although he was\nall pale and strained like a string.\n\nNow already I started explaining to the captain that the Turk didn’t have even a thought to\nbeat me. I told him the whole situation from the beginning to the end. I acknowledged that it was my fault\nthat I failed to prepare Ibrahim’s father for his son’s illness and that by doing so I gave rise to all this\nincident.\n\n“My young friend, that isn’t called an incident, but a little bit differently,” the captain was\ntalking to me by tenderly stroking my poor head. “Lovushka, please come to the young patient and stay\nwith him until we clear up this event in my study.”\n\n“I beg you, captain,” I seized the captain’s hand and I was whispering to him. “Don’t attach\nso much importance to this event. I told you everything clearly that the cause of this was I myself, right?\nNow help me to get out of all this mess, because the public is already starting to pay attention to us. You\nwere drinking brotherhood with me, so does your love to me look like those flowers which fade as soon as\nthey are touched stronger?”\n\nApparently, both my appearance and my voice were asking for sympathy, because it seemed\nas though the captain gave a smile. He told the clumsy sailor to accompany me to the Turk’s cabin and to\nstay there until I. came back.\n\n```\nHe invited the Turk and I. to follow him.\n```\n\nIt seemed that the captain’s hand had stopped and diminished the blow to my head to the\nminimum, however it was difficult for me to walk, I was leaning firmly upon the clumsy sailor and I could sit\ndown on the arm-chair with much difficulty. Everything was drifting in front of my eyes, I was sickened and\nonly now I could perceive that I could hardly stop myself from moaning.\n\nNow I cannot tell exactly for how long I was sitting in that arm-chair. It seemed to me that\nthe storm was starting once again, that I was being cast by the waves, that I was seeing the face of my\nwonderful friend Florentian who was bent over me...\n\nI woke up and I felt myself strong and sound. First of all, I saw the sad, pale and sorrowful\nface of the older Turk. He was sitting next to me.\n\n```\n“Has something happened?” I asked him by having forgotten the former circumstances.\n```\n“Glory to Allah!” he gave a shout. “Finally you came to yourself, and I won’t feel to be a\nmurderer anymore!”\n\n“What do you mean a murderer? What are you talking about? Why am I here?” I kept asking\nhim, having seen that I wasn’t lying in our cabin. “Where is I.? What has happened?”\n\n```\nI was trying to get up while talking and I already started worrying.\n```\n“In the name of Allah, lie calmly and don’t talk,” the Turk told me. “Because of that ill-fated\nblow of mine to you, you shiver with fever, you nauseate, you are delirious, and we have brought you here.\nMy son is lying here, too. The gangrene has started for him. I. didn’t move from both of you for three days.\nThree hours ago he declared that there were no danger for your lives anymore and he left me here to\nprotect you. Don’t try to get up, you are tied to the bed with belts, so that there would be as much peace as\npossible. I. told me to slacken the belts a little if you woke up until he was back, but you weren’t allowed to\nget up by any means. Lovushka, will you ever forgive me for such a dreadful act of mine? Not for the first\ntime in my life, I’m absolutely losing my self-control, and every time the cause of my fury is love. When the\ncaptain wanted to send me into solitary for the fight on the ship, and I was trying to explain to him that love\nto my son had made me lose my mind, he asked me ironically: “Who needs such love which is sowing\njealousy and scandals everywhere, and which only causes so much trouble instead of causing joy and\nmaking life easier?” I understand everything. Now I also understand the whole horror of that situation\nwhen my adorable son is afraid of me and he’s even hiding his pain from me – hence, he doesn’t see a\nfriend in me...”\n\n“You are thinking wrongfully, daddy,” all of a sudden a voice was heard from the adjacent\nbed. “I was a fool, because I was hiding my wound from everybody, thinking that everything would soon be\nover. Knowing well how you were praising an absolute self-control above all man’s qualities, I wanted to\nprotect you from an unnecessary disappointment in yourself, because I also knew perfectly how any\nanxiety for your loves ones was driving you mad. Namely my loyal friendship to you, to the man of\nextraordinary qualities, and my love to you as my father made me hide my wound from you. I had to make\nsure many times that I was unable to treat you in such a way that wouldn’t irritate you. Daddy, you know\nthat I don’t lose my self-control, I never raise my voice, and despite that, I cannot put into words my love\nand friendship to you in such external forms which wouldn’t excite your annoyance. Only my mother alone\ncan talk to you in all moments of life...”\n\nThe younger Turk fell silent, and in his face which I could see clearly now showed up a\ndreamy expression, while his eyes were wet and shining. It seemed that the picture of his adorable mother\nflew his thoughts to the distant memories about the great spirituality of the woman who was living a heroic\nlife.\n\n\nI was trying to imagine that woman who had lived her entire life next to such a barrel of\npowder like the older Turk. Unwillingly, I started comparing my own character with his and, by taking a\ndetached view, I understood how quarrelsome the unrestrained and ill-educated people were in everyday\nlife.\n\nI turned into Lovushka – the catcher of the crows, and my thoughts flew to the unknown\ndistances. I was imagining a woman who was unknown to anybody, but who succeeded to educate her son\nIbrahim so well in the daily chaos, while the storms of passions were raging. “What kind of a woman that\nmother was? What was her belief? What was her nationality?” All of a sudden the voice of the older Turk\nbrought me back from my dreams.\n\n“Mother, mother! Oh my son, if you knew how much your mother has suffered when she\nwas young because of my frenzied jealousy! How many times I was threatening her with the knife! But she\nnever had any fear, she was only protecting you, so that you wouldn’t see anything.”\n\nThe door opened suddenly and widely. I saw how the captain and I. entered the cabin. As\nalways, the faces of both of them were energetic, only they were unusually pale and strict. I. bent over me,\nstroked my head and asked me tenderly.\n\n```\n“Can you hear me, Lovushka?”\n```\nI gave him a smile, I wanted to raise my hand and greet him, but the belts didn’t let me to\nmove. It seemed to me that I was even laughing loudly by answering him: “I can hear you,” but in truth I\nhardly whispered these words and I felt very tired.\n\n```\n“Can you see, Lovushka, who came with me?” he asked me again.\n```\n“I see the captain who has drunk the brotherhood with me,” I answered him, “but I’m just\ntired for some reason.”\n\nAnd against my will I started yawning so madly that I didn’t even have any strength to press\nmy lips together.\n\n“I asked you to sit with the patients for a while in absolute silence. I explained to you how\ndangerous the slightest agitation for these patients was, “I heard the strict I.’s voice. It was so strict that I\nhad never heard it like this before. “And you, my friend, failed once again. Again you were thinking about\nyourself, and not about them.”\n\nNow I asked them to help me to turn on another side and let me fall asleep. I wasn’t\nexpecting this from the captain, but he bent over me and started to persuade me tenderly to lie on my back\nfor a while, because now we were sailing into the bay, we were approaching the harbour, and the ship\nwould toss a little, but soon we would sail up to the shore, then it would be calm, they would untie me and\nsit me up.\n\nHe extended his hand, took the glass with the medicine from I., put it to my lips and raised\nmy head so carefully, as though it had been made of a friable mass.\n\nI drank it and wanted to smile, but my yawning overcame me, then all of a sudden I\ndisappeared somewhere, or perhaps, I fell into a doze.\n\nI woke up in our cabin. The clumsy sailor was sitting next to me, and suddenly I saw a leaving\nwoman who crossing the cabin’s threshold. It seemed to me that that was Joan. From the rather silly and\nsincere expression of my nurse – the clumsy sailor I understood that that was really her. There was so much\n\n\nhumour in his face, so much jolly happiness that some beauty was worried about me that I couldn’t hold it\nanymore and I burst out laughing. This time it was really a loud laughter.\n\n“Oh! The coming back to life of my bold spirit also manifests itself with a laughter,” I heard\nthe ringing voice of the captain. “Hello, my friend! Finally, you are recovered. Wait, wait! How fast you are!\nLie down until I. comes, “he continued, not allowing me to get up.\n\nBut I kept laughing and I was fighting with him. The captain started begging me not to fuss, I\nsaw anxiety and worry in his face.\n\n“Dear, you understand yourself that after such serious illness you must be very careful. Lie\ncalmly, I will send somebody to invite I., and then you probably will be able to get up.”\n\nThe captain ordered the clumsy sailor who was as drawn as the string to find I. and to ask\nhim to come back to the cabin immediately.\n\nDuring that time the captain was answering to my questions and he explained to me that\ntoday was already the fifth day of my illness and that we would reach Constantinople towards evening.\n\nI became totally confused. My thoughts couldn’t draw up the events, I couldn’t remember\nanything from those five days, except the episode on the stairs, the blow, one more episode in the hospital\n\n- and that was it what remained in my memory.\n\nThe captain was entertaining me, he told me that I. was very worried about my vision and\nhearing. He was even sending the telegram to lord Benedict to London and to some doctors to B., asking for\nhelp and advice. He received an answer from B. very quickly and calmed down partly, but he received an\nanswer from London only yesterday. After I. received this telegram he stopped worrying about my recovery\nat all and took me here.\n\nIt became peaceful and clear in my heart. I understood that I. was sending telegrams to sir\nVomi and Florentian. This undeserved care summoned the great respect within me for the attention that\nwas simply poured before me.\n\nI wanted to ask the captain if I. was telling him something about my brother, but the thought\nabout the little word “tact” which Florentian kept repeating to me stopped me.\n\nI heard the quick and light steps which I recognized immediately, and already nobody could\nstop me anymore. I jumped like a cat from the bed and fell myself on my rescuer I.’s neck.\n\n“Lovushka, don’t be mad! You will suffocate me!” I. was crying to me, and both of them with\nthe captain put me back to bed.\n\n```\n“What are you doing, really? I cannot lie down anymore!”\n```\n“And now your heart is beating like a hammer, because you have tired it,” I. answered to my\nprotest. “You can only sit down in the arm-chair on the deck for a while, but even when we are in\nConstantinople, you still cannot walk for two or three days. If you want to be my assistant, if you want to\nhelp me to put Joan’s and her children’s lives in order, you have to show your character and to fulfil the\ndoctors’ instructions obediently. And the instructions are exactly such!”\n\nHe looked me up and down meaningfully and added that it was important to visit not only\nJoan, both signoras Italians and the Greek family, who wanted to see me as soon as possible and whom we\nwould need to help to put their lives in order somehow, but also the young duke who needed our\nguardianship and help mostly at the moment.\n\n\n“You understand yourself that I alone won’t be able to do all that. In order for you to be my\ntrue assistant, you will have to forget your personal wants and to think only about those miserable people.\nEveryone of them is unhappy in his or her own way, but all of them are equally suffering from their own\npassions.”\n\n```\nThe captain frowned. Finally he asked I.\n```\n“Tell me, friend, according to which laws of God and people you cross out the personal\nhappiness from this young life? Does he really have to keep roaming about only with the troubles of the\nstrangers when he could have a good time and live a happy life of the family father or the scientist? He\npossesses all the qualities that are needed for an excellent career, doesn’t he? He will be my brother, my\nheir. England is a wonderful country where everyone is living for himself and doesn’t trouble himself to pick\nother people’s disasters into their pockets, doesn’t hinder the lives of others.”\n\n“Lovushka is a grown-up and a free man. He has every right to choose any way. If he\nexpresses his desire to go with you and not with me, then you can move him to your own cabin right now,”\nI. answered him.\n\n“Lovushka, move to my cabin. We will go to England. I’m single. You will be rich. My family is\none of the best from the old landlords. My mother and my sister are charming women. They adore me and\nthey will accept you like their own. You will be able to choose your career freely. Don’t be afraid, I won’t\nthrust the sailor’s career on you, neither a bride whom you won’t want, don’t think that England cannot\nchange your motherland for you. You will love it when you know it better, and then everything what you\nwant – the science, arts, travelling, love – then you can reach everything. You will be happy and free from\nall those obligations with which you are being educated now. Man lives only once, and the value of life is\nhis personal experience, and not that you should forget yourself and think only about others,” the captain\nwas talking to me, while walking slowly in our spacious cabin.\n\n“I could give so much, oh how much, if I could be in London during these days,” I answered\nhim. “But I would like to get there namely because I could forget myself and think about others, my dear\nfriend. So, you can see yourself how it is impossible to coordinate our lives, although I love you very much, I\nlike you very much. And I like you not because I respond to you with gratitude for such wonderful feelings\nwith respect to me, but because you have grown firmly into my heart, as well as your great nobleness,\ncourage and honour. My path is next to I. Only this path can bring me happiness. I met one great man not\nso long ago, I have become fond of him and now I’m loyal to him forever. Oh, if I could introduce him to\nyou, I would be so happy! I know that you would evaluate him immediately, and then we could walk the\nsame path, in a brotherly way and inseparably. I thank you for your tenderness and attention. I know that\nyou are offering me the liberation according to your own understanding, because you think that I’m pulling\nthe yoke of high ideas, that I’m entrapped in them. No, I’m absolutely free; I. was telling the truth. Now I\nfeel happy that every moment of my worthless life up to now is dedicated to save my dear brother-father,\nmy brother-educator, the only being in the whole world with whom we have the same ties of blood. Death\nand persecution is threatening him, while I’m trying to mislead the persecutors and to get them off the\ntrack with the help of his friends and myself. I will walk this path till the end, even if my death was close and\ninescapable. While I’m still alive, I will try to see the suffering of people and, as you have put it, I will be\npicking it into my pockets.”\n\nThe captain kept silent and he was looking at me sadly. Finally, he extended his hand to me\nand told me.\n\n“Well then, put my bitterness into one of your pockets, too. Everything what I’m trying to\nachieve in my life is falling down. I had a fiancée – she broke her oath. I had a beloved brother – he passed\n\n\naway. I had luck in my family – my father left us. I had a desire for honour – a duel prevented my\nrespectable career. I met you – we didn’t become brothers. Your pockets must be bottomless. People are\negoistic beings: if they only see that someone is ready to throw their troubles on his shoulders, they sit\ndown on his hump and even seize him by the hair...”\n\n```\nHe was silent for a while and then continued silently by addressing I.\n```\n“If I could somehow help you and your brother, take advantage of my offered help. I don’t\nhave such attachments in my life which would fill it up fully. I was striving for them, seeking after them\nduring my entire life, but they were always running away from me like an illusion. I’m absolutely free. I love\nthe sea, because I don’t expect any stability and faithfulness from it. You are faithful to your love for your\nbrother and to some friend. You are happier than me. I don’t have anybody who would need my\nfaithfulness. My relatives manage without me easily.”\n\n“You are very wrong,” I. exclaimed in some especial voice. “Don’t you remember the little\nRussian girl who loved you to the total renunciation? The talented violinist named Lisa?”\n\n```\nThe captain stopped like thunderstruck.\n```\n“Lisa?! Lisa was fourteen years old. It would be naïve to think that it was serious. There was\nalso her aunt there, who was simply haunting with her love. She seemed to me like a funny old fairy, and I\nwas admiring the little jealous girl, but I never allowed myself to play with her feelings and I put the coolest\narmour of my courtesy and politeness on. I won’t argue with you, if the circumstances had been more\nfortunate, I could have fallen in love with this living being.”\n\n“And this living being cannot leave your portrait and she’s searching for all sorts of\npossibilities to meet you. Not her fault, but only a huge tragedy of her family prevented her from cruising\non this steamer and namely in this cabin.”\n\n“It cannot be the truth, Lisa’s surname was different, and the countess R. from Gurzuf\nbought the tickets to this cabin.”\n\n“Yes, but Lisa was using her aunt’s surname while she was staying in the seaside resort.\nPlease believe me that countess R. is nobody else, but Lisa. And if you perceive honestly that you fall in love\nwith that girl, then go to Gurzuf and meet Lisa. Her life is worth to be saved, and you have an opportunity\nto help the woman to live a happy life, not renouncing yourself. There are people who can love only once.\nLisa is one of them. And nothing – neither riches nor her talent – can give her happiness if her heart doesn’t\nhave a response. Don’t be cruel and light-minded. You were only playing with the girl’s feelings, thinking\nthat her love was transitory, weren’t you? But actually, it turned out that her life was already broken. If you\ndelay, her health may break down, too.”\n\nThere were no limits to my amazement: I was thinking if I loved Lisa, what she felt for me.\nNow I remembered some of the details of her behaviour, her attentive look when she said good-bye to I. in\nSevastopol. She must have confided the secret of her heart to him.\n\n```\nThe captain kept silent for a long time. No one from us was disturbing this silence.\n```\n“Strange, everything is so strange,” finally he sighed. “How it is wonderful that everything in\nour lives is happening so fast. So fast! Less than an hour ago, it seemed to me that my life without Lovushka\nwould be futile. He won me over to his side with his heroism. When he answered me several minutes ago, I\nwas going through the tragedy of disappointment and loss, and now as though I begin to see things clearly.\nDoctor I., I trusted you from the beginning, I excluded you from all meetings of my life in a special way, but\nin this moment your words as though took a screen off my thoughts and heart, I start hoping for real value\n\n\nlife for myself. What an egoist I am! I have already unrolled the flying carpet of my dreams in my thoughts,\nbut I have forgotten what Lovushka was just telling me. No, I won’t start creating my new life until I haven’t\nhelped the business of Lovushka and yourself.”\n\n“Everyone has to walk his own path, and it is impossible to walk a stranger’s path even for a\nspan,” I. told him. “We will meet you and your future wife Lisa – if you listen to the real voice of your heart\n\n- many times, and every time you will be able to render us your friendly and rather significant assistance.\nLet life lead all of us in such a way as it is doing so. And believe me that everyone of us is walking in such a\nway how better, easier and faster it is for him to reach the happiness of knowing. We’ll be writing to you, I\nthink you also will be doing so. And if you permit, I have a great favour to ask you now. Help us to settle the\nduke and his wife in some quite good villa in Constantinople. It will be very difficult to carry her out of the\nship, because we can carry her only in our arms, and you know the curiosity of the crowd and how it will be\ndifficult for the unfortunate husband to bear the mockery of the public when they see such a decrepit wife\nnext to him.”\n\n“It is more than simple to arrange everything,” the captain answered him. “A Greek family is\ncruising in one of the cabins – but actually, you know them, too, you were treating them during the storm.\nThey have a quite big house with the big garden in which they don’t reside themselves, but they are only\nletting it. The boy mentioned to me that the house is free at the moment. If it is really so, then I will give\nyou some people, and they will carry the old woman over to that house at night by using the stretcher. She\nwill feel well there, while the duke will have a chance not to feel embarrassed of the strangers and to live\nalone, not accepting any other tenants in the house or garden. I will clear this up and let you know by\nsending someone to you. Now I have to go, because it is high time already.”\n\n```\nAnd having squeezed our hands, the captain left.\n```\nI didn’t want to talk at all. I. went up to my bed, sat down on the chair that was standing\nnear, took my hand and checked my pulse.\n\nHe had already counted my pulse long time ago and made sure that my heart wasn’t beating\nanymore, but he was still sitting next to me by holding my hand.\n\n“My dear boy!” he told me silently. “We have just started our real path, and it seems to you\nthat you’ve already been suffering for the whole century. Is really everything what you have to experience\nso unexpectedly bringing only suffering, bitterness and worries to you? Imagine that now you are happy\nnext to your brother and you are provided with everything. Then would you have met Ali, Florentian and sir\nVomi? Then would you have known that there were not only the town-dwellers who were looking for\nbenefit only for themselves on the earth, but there were also the people who have set the spirit within\nthemselves like the fire of their hearts’ creation, like the everlasting activity of love and calm for the\npeople’s welfare? Take a look at your current heart and you will see how its limits have widened in\ncomparison to the past! Oh, if you could take a look at Florentian’s heart, you would see such a\ntremendous lot of beauty in it! Your grey daily like next to him would brighten up with such light and\ncharm! The whole man’s happiness depends on the power of his spirit, on that altitude to which he can rise\nand cast a glance. If a sensitive string of desire for a body and passions sounds within yourself, then your\ndreams are hovering only over charming and desirable bodies. If your thought is raising you to the heights\nof spiritual love, and you can already hear the voice of another man’s heart, then this accord arises not\nfrom the material choice, but from the influence of that power of vibrations which the power of your\ncreative heart is sending to the surroundings. Fly to Florentian in your thoughts, and if you are capable of\nperceiving the grandeur of his thoughts and spirit, then his love will be able to respond to your love, to the\nneeds of your thought and to the creative work of your heart in your grey daily routine. The easier and\nmore sincerely your thoughts will be trying to merge with his great wisdom to live in the simplest kindness\n\n\nevery day, the calmer you will stay in all circumstances of your life, in all menacing dangers, - the easier it\nwill be for your great friend to unite with you.”\n\nI still was unable to understand everything what I. was telling me. Many things seemed to be\nunclear to me, something seemed to be even impossible, but I didn’t want to interrogate him.\n\nI obeyed to I.’s instruction to lie on the deck willingly, because I didn’t want to see anybody,\nmy brother’s books were drawing me. The clumsy sailor settled me on the deck perfectly, I. sat down next\nto me to write his letters, and I laid out the books and instead of rejoicing at them... I fell asleep.\n\nWe reached Constantinople without any adventures. Only parting with the captain was so\nexciting that it moved me to tears. He gave me his portrait in an excellent frame, left his London address\nand assured us that he would come to our hotel in the morning and, if I. was busy with his affairs, he would\nbe glad to stay next to me for a while. We hugged one another heartily, and with the help of the clumsy\nsailor and I., I was one of the last ones climbing down the stairs of the steamer.\n\n\n# Chapter 16\n\n## In Constantinople\n\nThe late evening in Constantinople was one of the impressions that surprised me most. An\nunusual dialect, the racket, the fezzes which were flashing in front of my eyes, the employees of the hotels\nwho were carping at the people going shore from all sides, the guttural voices, the noise of the strange,\nunseen fiacres – all of it fell over me, and I probably would have been confused if Joan with her children\nhadn’t drawn my attention. She was accompanied by the ship’s doctor and both Italians who were met by\ntheir relatives with high posts, - and all of them were waiting for us on the shore.\n\nJoan hurried towards me, she was asking I. kindly to allow her to nurse me until I recover and\nto repay us for our entire attention to her at least with such a small service.\n\nI gave a laugh and answered her that I was absolutely healthy and that I obeyed his\ninstructions and I was pretending to be a patient only because of my love and respect to him.\n\nThen the Italians introduced me to their relatives. A respectable ambassador offered us to\nsettle me in his remote house, but I. refused his offer categorically by assuring everybody that the hotel’s\nnoise would be even useful for me, because I wasn’t allowed only to walk for a while.\n\nThe Italians were sorry, because I wasn’t coming with them. They said good-bye to us and\npromised to visit me tomorrow in the hotel and then they left.\n\nThe hotel wasn’t far and we were going on foot together with Joan and her children very\nslowly and not for very long. The Turks were already waiting for us at the hotel. They had time to order the\nrooms on the same floor for us and Joan.\n\nAs soon as we reached our floor, I noticed how Joan pined away and changed. She whispered\nto my question what was making her so sad.\n\n“While you were ill, I went through such horror, such horror that also now I still cannot fully\nrecollect myself, often I’m crying and shaking during the whole hours.”\n\n“Well, you see how ruinous a fear can be,” I. interfered. “I was explaining to you many times\nthat Lovushka would recover. Now he’s healthy, and before you start your job, I will have to treat you.”\n\n“No, I can assure you that you won’t have to treat me! If you like, I can start my job\ntomorrow, only that if I knew that Lovushka is healthy and cheerful,” Joan answered I.\n\nWe went to our rooms. I thanked the clumsy sailor heartily for his care. I. wanted to repay\nhim generously, but the kind-hearted lad didn’t take the money. He attached to us during that short\njourney and asked us to let him visit us, while the steamer would be repaired on the shore.\n\nAlthough I didn’t want to confess that I wasn’t absolutely healthy, but it wasn’t easy for me\nto undress. Everything started floating in front of my eyes again.\n\nI don’t know if I was sleeping for a long time, but I woke up from the voices in the adjacent\nroom. Having looked at the clock, I saw that it wasn’t an early morning, but ten o’clock already. I was trying\nto dress myself silently and I touched the chair clumsily. I. heard the noise. He opened the door\nimmediately and asked me if I didn’t fall down.\n\n\nHaving made sure that everything was all right, he offered me to drink a cup of coffee with\nthe captain in the balcony, because he was already waiting for me, and then to have breakfast with Joan,\nwhile he and the Turks would be running about with Joan’s affairs.\n\nI understood that at the presence of the captain I. didn’t want to talk about our business\nbecause of which actually we had come here, and I didn’t doubt that he was going to find out about my\nbrother’s destiny.\n\nWhile being together with the captain, I had an opportunity to make sure of this man’s\nversatility and culture once again. Besides that he had seen the whole world while sailing around the earth\nseveral times already – he also knew each country’s characteristic features and could speak almost every\nlanguage. His unusual observation and purely sailor’s vigilance and attention which were developed in the\ndangers of the insidious sea had taught him to observe people and to estimate them nearly impeccably. I\nwas surprised how accurately and subtly he described I., how he guessed some of the features of my\ncharacter, and what he told about Joan simply stunned me. In his opinion, now Joan almost reached the\nlimit of the mental disorder because of her experienced shock.\n\n“A woman,” he was telling me, “can rarely survive alone in the moments of the greatest\ndisaster. Not sensing it herself, she’s pressing herself to the man who has shown her attention and\ntenderness in order to put out the fire of her passions a little, which are raging after loss of her beloved.\nTherefore, a man, an honest gentleman must be very careful, very attentive to each of his word and action\nin order to avoid an ambiguous situation. I had a chance to observe many times in my life how a man who\nwas comforting a woman in her bad luck would get into a hopeless situation. The woman would fall on him\nwith the whole burden of her suffering, would attach to him so tightly that he would have either to marry\nher or to run away from her by arousing the new suffering for her.”\n\nThese words were hurting me. I. was telling me the same or almost the same. Unawares, I\nfell silent and I fell to thinking how it was still difficult for me to orient myself in people’s feelings, how\nsimply everything seemed to me, but in fact the thorns and splinters were hiding everywhere.\n\nWe started talking about Joan who had to have breakfast with us. The captain sent for the\nmaitre d’hotel, he ordered him to bring a subtle French breakfast to my room, which looked like a dinner\nfor three persons. He ordered him to decorate the table with roses, and I asked them to be of red and\nwhite colours.\n\nAt one o’clock the table was already laid. I wrote a note to Joan by asking her to come to\nhave breakfast. There came a knock at the door, and the slender Joan’s figure with the white dress came to\nlight in the dark background of the door.\n\nI met my guest at the threshold and, having kissed her hand, I invited her at the table. I still\nhadn’t seen Joan such radiant and joyful. At once she started asking me a lot of questions about my general\ncondition, about I., for how long we would stay in Constantinople – I didn’t even know to which one of the\nquestions I had to answer in the beginning.\n\n“I’m so glad, so glad that I will be able to spend this moment with you, because I have a\nthousand of things to tell you and another thousand questions to ask you – and there’s always no time to\ndo that.”\n\n“Let me introduce you to my friend whom you know as the ship’s captain, but you don’t\nknow what an excellent company and a wonderful cavalier he is,” finally, I took advantage of the pause and\ninterfered in her speech.\n\n\nAs soon as Joan stepped into the cabin, she fixed her gaze on me so much that she didn’t\neven notice the captain who was standing aside by the table. The captain went to her, smiling. He handed\nthe white and red roses to her. He bent down towards her hand, he was greeting her like a duchess and,\nhaving offered her his arm, he accompanied her at the table.\n\nWhen we sat down, I couldn’t recognize Joan anymore. Her face was cold and strict, I didn’t\neven know that it could be like this.\n\nI was embarrassed, I took a look at my friend, because I felt confused, but I was unable to\nread anything in the captain’s face. His face was also unknown to me – it was the face of the courteous and\ngallant man who was doing his duties at the table and taking care of the lady out of courtesy. He was\nsmiling, his yellow catlike eyes were looking at her kind-heartedly, but I was feeling that Joan was fettered\nby the armour of his gallantry and she was unable to overstep those limits which he had defined for her\ninstantly.\n\nAll her hopes to see me in solitude and to share her thoughts about her new life with me\nfrom the bottom of her heart broke from the presence of the stranger – and even of such a grand one who\npossessed the halo of power and authority, with which each captain was covered in the sea.\n\nJoan’s monosyllabic answers, her appearance and lack of culture would have turned each\nbreakfast into a funeral dinner, but the captain’s moderation, the mastery of his speech made me laugh\nthrough tears. Joan had difficulty to understand humour, but when the breakfast was coming to the end,\nshe became cheerful and more sincere, too. The captain apologized and went to order some special coffee\nin the cups, which we would be drinking in the balcony.\n\nHaving taken advantage of this possibility, Joan told me that tonight she had to meet the\nTurk who would provide her with the premises for the shop and for the flat in one of the central streets\nwhere she could open the hat’s atelier. She kept telling me how frightened she was, how terrible her\nsolitude was and what fears she had because of the destiny of her children.\n\nI had time to tell her that I. would never leave her, that both of us were her eternal friends\nwherever we would be. I failed to comfort her very much, because I was afraid of telling her some\nimprudent word.\n\nThe captain came back and brought us some excellent oranges. Soon the famous coffee was\nserved, too, but Joan was sitting like dragged out of the bog, she refused the fruit and left. I could hardly\nconvince her of taking an orange of each of her children, while the captain’s roses were left on the table.\nThe captain accompanied her to the door, he bowed low, let her forward and closed the door behind her.\n\nHe came back to me to the balcony, took both roses given to Joan, breathed in their aroma,\nlaughed and told me.\n\n“Not often in my life I used to suffer a defeat at the front of ladies, but today even my\nflowers, not only I myself have experienced a fiasco.”\n\n“And it influenced me so much,” I answered him, “that I even have a headache. For some\nreason I think that the poor lady is crying now. And indeed, it is a pity that I’m so helpless and I cannot help\nher.”\n\n“Not your helplessness is here to blame, but the lack of real culture and politeness. Exactly\nthis could help a woman in the difficult moment of her life’s tests. She must become a woman-heroine,\nwhile at the moment she’s only a woman-wife, a townswoman. It doesn’t mean that in the future she\nwon’t be able to rise to the circle of other thoughts and ideas, but the battle of her personal happiness, for\n\n\nher personal life will be horrible. While she’s unable to refuse love for herself and to start living for her\nchildren – she’s going to wade across the torments of hell. So I bowed so low to those torments today,” the\ncaptain was talking to me, lost in thought.\n\n“Is it really so that if you loved once, if you loved till an absolute oblivion, but you have lost\nyour heart’s heaven, then you have to search for it again? I think that either you should love a hundred\ntimes, but not seriously, or love with your entire essence once, but in such a way that you could never\napproach a single woman again,” I answered him.\n\n“I cannot judge that. Perhaps, I’ve already lived the greater half of my life and I still haven’t\nwaited till that moment so that I could tell: “stop, moment.” Everywhere where people are obsessed with\ntheir passions and cannot become the rulers of their thoughts and hearts, I could see only inexhaustible\namount of suffering...”\n\nThe captain’s speech was interrupted by the knock at the door, and the duke showed up at\nthe doorway when we invited him to come in.\n\nHaving the patient’s right, I remained lying on the coach, under the screen of the curtains of\nthe balcony, while the captain was smiling to hi warmly, he met the guest, squeezed his hand in a friendly\nway and seated him next to me.\n\nThe duke explained to us that he already visited the ship where he was looking for the\ncaptain. He wanted to thank him for his help provided to his sick wife, he was also thanking us, but he\nwanted to ask me and I. to visit the patient.\n\nHe looked rather badly. He was elegantly dressed, but his face was sallow, his eyes were\nfeverish, and everything within him was telling about his utter physical exhaustion and mental\nderangement.\n\nThe captain was smiling and he told him that he was very sorry that he wasn’t the doctor,\nbecause then he would prescribe the bed regime not to his wife, but to himself. I assured the duke that I.\nwould certainly visit him, but I doubted if he had time today, because he left early in the morning and\npromised to come back only in the evening, but he also had lots of affairs to do in the evening.\n\nHaving spent another hour with us, the duke asked us for permission to visit us tomorrow in\nthe morning in order to find out when I. could visit his wife.\n\nWe didn’t have time to exchange our impressions about Constantinople when there came a\nknock at the door again and signoras Galdoni with the bouquets of roses in their hands entered the cabin.\nBoth of them were radiating with joy. Their speech was cheerful and lively, they invited me, I. and the\ncaptain to visit them in the wonderful palace of embassy. The captain explained to them that at the\nmoment he was nursing me, that I. was asserting him that I still had to stay in bed for two or three days,\nbut then he promised them to present me to them himself.\n\nThe good manners and noble company were blowing softy from the Italians, while the\ncharming, bottomless and kind eyes of the young Galdoni were arousing the best feelings in my soul, her\ncharming womanhood was penetrating till the bottom of my heart.\n\n“This is what the poor, sweet Joan lacks,” I told the captain. “She’s better than many others,\nbut she cannot control herself, just like me. Only because I’m ill-bred, I’m always irritated, right? Maybe\nthat’s why I can understand Joan better than others.”\n\n\n“No, my friend. There’s nothing in common between your and her ill breeding. You are only\nunexperienced and you cannot control neither your temperament nor your thoughts, but the circle of your\nwants and ideas, the world of your high aspirations in which you are living, - everything is guiding you to\nthe space of those happy people who achieve an ability to be of use to their brothers on the earth. Sooner\nor later you will find your individual, unique path that is impossible for another person and you will bring\nsomething new to your life, I’m sure that it’ll be great and significant for the common welfare. And\nregarding Joan, well – thank goodness if her endless personal suffering would release at least a mother’s\nlove within her and could help her to become a mother-helper, a mother-assistant to her children, and not\na mother-tyrant. There are many cases when a mother’s suffered pain becomes a despotism for her\nchildren! In the meanwhile, it seems to her that her love is the greatest deed.”\n\nI was looking at the captain with my eyes opened wide. His face was wonderful. Such a deep\nconcentration was reflected on it, which I used to see only on the faces of I., Florentian and Ali.\n\n```\nMy silence made him turn around.\n```\n“Why are you looking at me like this, my boy, my brotherhood brother? What new have you\nseen within me,” he asked me by touching my shoulder easily and tenderly.\n\n“Not only I saw something new within you, but I also understood that you really need to\nbecome acquainted with my friend Florentian. He’s such a great man that I haven’t met another one like\nhim up to now. Even I. whom you exclude from others cannot compete with him, although I admit from the\nbottom of my heart that I. is an ideal of unreachable height and kindness for me. You don’t know my friend\nFlorentian, but you uttered those words that I used to hear from him two times already. Oh, if such\nhappiness came, and I could introduce you to him!”\n\n```\nI even didn’t notice I. who came in.\n```\n“It seems that you’re having a good time together, but why I don’t see Joan? I agreed with\nher that she would be waiting for me here with you, Lovushka, and that I would be able to let her know\nimmediately about where and how she would be making arrangements about her job. Did two such gallant\ncavaliers fail to dispel the storm of sadness of one lady?” he asked us by squeezing our hands cheerfully.\n\n“No,” the captain answered him. “The lady has taught me obedience. She even left my\nflowers, while the perfectly selected menu was unsuccessful at all. I think that I’m namely that reason\nwhich took the appetite and good mood from the lady. If I hadn’t received your instruction to stay with\nLovushka, I’m afraid that I would have run away from the battle-field.”\n\n“I., Joan upset me very much. Once again I failed to remain tactful, I brought disorder in her\nlife again, although I wanted to bring in peace. It seems that the perspective of a sincere and joyful contact\nwith such a gawk like myself is supposed only for black women,” I was complaining ironically to I.\n\n```\n“What kind of black women?” the captain gave a shout.\n```\n“This is the first and memorable Lovushka’s acquaintance with the black-skinned woman in\nB. For the first time in his life, he saw an educated, elegant, black-skinned woman not in the picture, but\nwhile he was visiting the family of one of my friends, so he was shocked,” I. answered him. “For some\nreason you are pale, Lovushka. I would like that you would come down carefully to the garden with the\ncaptain and would sit there for a while in the shadow. However sorry I feel for you, but you will have to\ntake part in my conversation with Joan before that trader who gives the premises to her comes. Captain, I\nalso would like to ask you very much to stay with us during that hour, because I guess that it will be very\ndifficult for Joan to start the new life of the single, working woman. It is a pity, but I failed to find out\n\n\nanything about her uncle. There’s an information that he fell ill and moved away to his relatives in the\nprovinces, but there aren’t any further tracks of him.”\n\nThe captain agreed willingly to stay with me in the garden and then to come back. I. asked us\nif we protested to miss the dinner and to have our supper only late in the evening. We assented to him.\nWhile we were going downstairs to the garden, we met both Turks. The younger Turk joined us, while the\nolder one went to I.\n\nThe youth was still walking with difficulty. He was using the stick, but he wasn’t feeling any\nspecial pain in his leg and back anymore. He had worked out the whole plan what we had to see in\nConstantinople. I was fascinated by his mentioned, historical places both in the city and in its environs, but I\nthought that probably I wouldn’t have time to see at least a half of it.\n\nI wanted to hear from I. about my brother and our future destiny very much, but... already\nnot for the first time during these days, I was learning patience and self-control.\n\nTowards evening, the servant in the name of I. asked us to tea. The table was laid no less\ncarefully than the captain’s one during the breakfast. The table was standing in the big I.’s room, it was\nglittering with silver and loaded with all sorts of Eastern sweets.\n\nWhen we entered, I. hurried away to invite Joan. He didn’t come back for quite a long time. I\nalready started worrying and getting irritated when finally they came by continuing their conversation\nwhich obviously wasn’t very pleasing for Joan.\n\nShe had a modest, blue dress on, which especially emphasized her paleness. Having bowed\nto me and the captain, she greeted both Turks and sat down on the seat which I. showed to her. I. sat down\nnext to her, me and the captain – in front of them, the Turks – from their right side, and there was a free\nplace left from the left side of Joan.\n\nWe didn’t have time to take our places when a tall, slender, absolutely grey, elderly man with\nrather sharp and beautiful facial features knocked lightly at the door and entered the room.\n\nI. rose to meet him, he introduced him to everybody and invited him to sit down next to\nJoan. He presented him to us as Boris Fyodorovich Stroganoff.\n\nI took a good look at Stroganoff and I wouldn’t have called him a Russian in any way. His face\nwas the one of a typical Turk with a hooked nose, big black eyes and black eye-brows. It was smoothly\nshaven, which suited more for an actor rather than for a trader.\n\nThe joint conversation started, in which Joan wasn’t taking part at all. I could see the traces\nof tears and powder on her face. I sympathized sincerely with the poor woman and I was tormenting\nmyself, because it was so difficult to transfer energy from one heart to another one. I was sure that\neverybody who were sitting at the table had gathered only to help her. And nevertheless, everyone’s joint\nwill could hardly help her self-control. I was looking so intently at Stroganoff that he started laughing and\ntold me.\n\n```\n“Young man, I bet that you are a writer.”\n```\n```\nEverybody gave a laugh, and I asked him, wonderstruck.\n```\n```\n“Why did you draw such a conclusion all of a sudden?”\n```\n“Because I’ve seen all kinds of people during my long life and I noticed that only the eyes of\ntalented writers were such awls that one becomes uncomfortable because of them. I absolutely don’t want\n\n\nto say that your showed attention is unpleasant to me. I want to assure you that I’m not a secret\npersonality at all and you won’t find any crime hidden from justice in my past, so I’m not that interesting,”\nhe was smiling and he extended his cigar-case to me.\n\n“Thank you, I haven’t learned to smoke yet,” I answered him. “Forgive me for such an\nattentive look of mine, this is only my ill breeding. I’m extremely absent-minded and from my childhood my\nnickname is Lovushka – the catcher of the crows. I hope that you can forgive me and that you won’t be\nstrict for such a rude curiosity of mine.”\n\n```\nI was totally distressed, because I directed the guest’s attention to me so unsuccessfully.\n```\nHe rose from his chair, bowed easily before me and answered me politely that his remark\nwasn’t a challenge, but only a bad compliment, and that he got even with me in this.\n\n```\nI. asked him if he was living in Constantinople for a long time already.\n```\n“Yes, I’ve been living here for a long time. I was born here,” Stroganoff explained to him. “My\nfather was the captain of the commercial ship and he often used to come to Constantinople. So one time\nhe became acquainted with a half-Russian, half Turkish family and married one of their daughters. I\nresemble my mother very much, that’s why my family name doesn’t correspond to my appearance so\nmuch. My other family members are blond and corpulent. I was born in that house where the premises of\nthe shop are free now, but back then that street wasn’t one of the main ones like it is now. From whom\nwould you like to rent them?”\n\n“We would like to rent them for your neighbour, so that she could open the hat atelier,” I.\nanswered him.\n\nI. noticed that Stroganoff turned to Joan, so he warned him that his neighbour was French\nand she was talking only her language.\n\nThe guest began to speak in French. He was speaking easily, with a little accent, but\nabsolutely correctly.\n\nMy heart started beating out of excitement. I was so afraid that the rude Joan’s behaviour\nwould make Stroganoff to change his mind and would cause difficulty for the rent, but he, as though not\nnoticing anything, was explaining the advantages of the street, house and interior design to her in a very\nbusiness-like and pleasant way. According to his words, there was a small villa downstairs – the shop with\nthe antechamber, while upstairs there was a two-room flat with the kitchen, which had a way out to the\nyard and the wonderful garden.\n\nSeeing that Joan kept silent, he offered to take her tomorrow in the morning and to show\nher the premises. If the repairs were needed, then it would be possible to do it quickly.\n\nI. thanked Boris Fyodorovich, he explained to him that Joan was the niece of that man about\nwhom he was searching the information in the morning, that she would have to stay in Constantinople\nalone with her two little children, because all of us would leave, except the Turks.\n\n```\nStroganoff turned to Joan again. The tears were rolling down her face.\n```\n“Don’t upset yourself, madam,” he was talking to her. All of us are fighting in our lives and all\nof us start with a very little – only to make our bread. It is your fortune that you met the people who turned\nout to be the real people and who are taking care of you now. This is a rare luck. It seems that you’ve\ndeserved an exceptional favour of fate with something, because I will be glad to help you, too. I have\ntwenty-seven years old daughter who lost her groom when she was seventeen years old, then she didn’t\n\n\nwant to marry again. I always wanted to begin an independent business. If you could teach her to do your\ntrade, then to accept her as your companion, then both the shop and its installation would cost you half as\nmuch.”\n\nJoan’s face became brighter. The smile showed up in her lips, and with the childish\nconfidence she extended both of her hands to Stroganoff.\n\n“I will be happy to have a companion. I know my trade very well, the ladies usually lose their\nminds for my hats, but I absolutely don’t know the book-keeping and accounts, and this side of the business\neven frightens me. I would be happier if you could just hire me, while the whole business would be yours.”\n\n“I think that this won’t correspond to your friends’ plans,” Stroganoff answered her. “As I\nunderstood from your friend’s speech and as I would wish it for my own daughter myself, you have to live\nindependent, you have to work and to bring up your children. Only be brave. My daughter doesn’t know\nanything about financial accounts, too, but she’s intelligent, diligent, and I will be guiding you in your\nfinancial operations from the beginning. It is everything easy for a man if he doesn’t cry, if he isn’t afraid of\nanything, but if he starts his job easily and fearlessly. I noticed many times that in business not those who\nhave lots of money win, but those who have started their business easily.”\n\nEverything was decided. Joan, I. and Stroganoff hat to meet in the future atelier tomorrow at\neleven o’clock.\n\nI was looking at I. pleadingly, not daring to ask him for permission to come with him, but I.,\nforeseeing my want, explained to Stroganoff that I was very ill and that I wasn’t allowed neither to walk nor\nto jolt in the coach. So I. asked Stroganoff if it was possible to cover a part of the way by water. Boris\nFyodorovich answered him that we could go to the old defensive tower by boat, then in two blocks there\nwould be the shop, but we would have to row at least for half of hour.\n\n“We’ll do exactly this,” the captain said to Joan by looking at her, “if the whole company is\ninviting us.”\n\nJoan gave a laugh and told him that she would be happy, but whether Lovushka himself\nwould want to do it. This looked so funny for everybody, because my evident desire to see everything by\nmyself was simply writ large on my face.\n\nStroganoff finished drinking his tea and said good-bye to us by smiling benevolently. The old\nTurk volunteered to accompany him, because the urgent matters were waiting for him in his house, too.\n\nWhen they left, I. handed two big batches of bank-notes to Joan and explained to her that\nthey were meant for her children. If now she had to spend some of the money for the beginning of the\nbusiness, then as soon as there would be some profit, she had to lay it aside, because his friends had given\nthe money for education of her children.\n\n“Probably I should only thank you and your friends, mister senior doctor, but I cannot\nunderstand in any way – is really my entire life only for my children? Don’t I really signify anything at all,\nbecause during the whole journey no one has told me personally a kinder word, and all the troubles are\nrunning only on my children?” Joan was asking I. “I’m very dedicated to my children, I want to work and I\nwill be working for them, but is it really everything over for me, because I have lost my husband? So I’m not\nallowed even to look at people? I’m stunned with such a tyrannical attitude.”\n\nHysteria rang in her face, and I remembered the captain’s words that Joan was on the\nboundary of a mental disease.\n\n\n“One day,” I. answered her, “you will probably perceive how terrible it is that what you are\ntalking about now. You are very ill, very unhappy and you are unable to estimate the entire tragedy of your\ndisposition. Everything what we could do for you we did, but nobody can give peace to your heart, and that\nis the first condition of your successful work. You see happy and restrained people among us, and it seems\nto you that we are exactly such how you are thinking about us, but in truth, my dear Joan, you cannot\nimagine how many tragedies some of us have gone through. I don’t ask anything from you now, only don’t\ngive in to the sorrow of this moment and don’t think that if Lovushka and I are leaving, then you won’t have\nany comfort anymore. You will find comfort in your successful work. Only for now don’t think about love\nlike the only possibility to restore your balance. Trust my experience that life without work is the\nunhappiest one, but when there’s a work, then the whole life is already half-happy.”\n\nJoan didn’t answer him any word, but I understood that a husband and love had taken the\nfirst place in her psychology, and only then her children followed, while work was only a necessary addition\nto it.\n\nThe younger Turk promised Joan to bring her an old nurse Turk who was living in their family\nfor many years.\n\n```\nIn this way Joan’s life was being put in order as if a fairy had waved her wand.\n```\nI. interrupted our not so absolutely happy drinking of the tea by offering us to depart and by\nreminding everybody about my condition. While Joan was saying good-bye to me, she told me that she\nwould agree to rent the house only in this case if I assented to it. I didn’t have time to answer her more\nexhaustively, I only had time to utter her that I myself was following I.’s advices and I offered her to catch\neach of his words, not mine.\n\nThe captain and the younger Turk went downstairs to the restaurant. I. and I refused the\nfood categorically, and finally the two of us were left alone.\n\nWe went to the balcony. It was the dark night already, which seemed to me like the real\nfairy-tale: I had never seen such wonderful sky and unusual stars. This strange and extraordinary city with\nits lights seemed to be unreal to me, like a panorama of a fairy-tale.\n\n“I don’t have many new news, besides the ones which I have already imparted to you. Our\npersecutors died in the sea, but I received the letter from Ali, in which he asks us to stay in Constantinople\nuntil Ananda comes here. Then all of us together will be moving to India, to Ali’s estate. I received the\ntelegram from Florentian. He’s writing that your brother and Nal came to London, but I think that they\nwould have to go to New York where Florentian himself would accompany them to,” I. was speaking to me.\n\n“Am I really going to India with you and my brother to America, not even seeing one another\nbefore our separation?” I asked I. sadly.\n\n“Lovushka, if you saw your brother in front of you now, could you, after your first meeting\nwith him, ask him all those questions which have appeared in your soul, which still are living there and to\nwhich you would like to get some detailed answers? You have been living with your brother for so many\nyears and only now you understand that your and his spiritual lives are spinning around the different axes.\nNot the physical meeting is important, but that you could understand your brother without any questions\nand tears, that you could find the answers to all of it within yourself. You have to learn a lot, so that you\ncould understand your brother’s books. You will find an excellent library in Ali’s estate, while young Ali will\nbe your friend and assistant. You can still choose at this moment. If you want to go to your brother,\nFlorentian will take you with him, and Ananda will take you to him. However, if you, knowing from your\nexperience how it is difficult to be living with the people who are superior than you, not being able to\n\n\nunderstand them, want to stay with me and Ali, then you’ll be able to become a strong assistant both to\nFlorentian and your brother who will still need your help many times. You are free to choose your path\nyourself, but for some reason it seems to me that both your intuition and your talent are already telling you\nthemselves that you cannot leave that what you’ve already started. While we are living here and signing in\nyour name, those who are persecuting your brother will certainly come here as soon as they receive this\nmessage, and while we will be their target, your brother and Nal will have time to move to America. I won’t\nhide from you my anxiety, too. Although the mad Turk’s blow haven’t killed you in place, it shook you so\nmuch that it affected your whole organism anyway. With the help of your cheerful will, you have to try to\nkeep your balance all the time. Every time when you begin to get excited or to irritate, think about\nFlorentian, remember his perfect self-control which have been saving you many times along your path. Also\nthink about Joan whose behaviour you understand perfectly as inappropriate. The more and more\nthoroughly you will be going deeper in your circumstances, the easier it will be for you to perceive when\nyou are more valuable for your brother and Florentian – now, when everything seems to be secret for you,\nor when you acquire some knowledge and understand that there are no secrets in nature, and that there’s\nonly one or another level of knowledge.”\n\nWe went to our rooms, but I couldn’t fall asleep. Now I could understand Joan who was\nseeking for her personal happiness so perfectly...\n\nNow all my happiness could go into meeting with my brother and Florentian. It seemed to\nme that I didn’t want anything else. Even if I wasn’t suited for anything else, I would agree to be their\nservant, to clean their shoes and clothes, only if I could see their dear faces, hear their voices and not the\nmoans of my heart because of the separation with them. I was already about to burst into tears when all of\na sudden I remembered Stroganoff’s words that he could often see that those who used to start their paths\neasily would win. I even became red in the face. I compared myself to Joan once again and I saw that so\nmany people were helping me, just like her, and that I had also seized the desire for my personal happiness\nblindfold, just like her.\n\nI tried to forget myself, I directed my thoughts to Florentian with all my strength, and\nsuddenly the familiar face emerged next to me again and I heard my dear voice: “Be strong. Not always\nman receives that much as you do now. Don’t miss the opportunity to learn; man receives a call for\nknowledge only once in his life and there’s no another time. Learn to love people well, and for the real love\nneither separation nor time exists. Preserve peace and your place next to I. without any fear, any lie, but\nwith joy. Always remember: joy is an unbeatable power.”\n\nAn unusual silence fell within myself. As though with inner insight, I understood easily and\nsimply how I should keep on living. I fell in an undisturbed sleep and I was really happy.\n\nI woke up in the morning only when I. was waking me up. He was telling me that the clumsy\nsailor and the captain were waiting for me downstairs in order to boat to the meeting’s place and that I had\nto breakfast on the boat.\n\nI put my clothes on quickly, but I didn’t have time to put on my coat, while the clumsy sailor\nwas already here and he was explaining to me that it wasn’t a great sailor’s way to dress himself for so long.\nHe didn’t allow me to take my coat, he told me that there was a raincoat and a plaid on the boat, but it was\nalso warm without them.\n\nHe was showing me the way through some yards, and although we were walking slowly,\nsoon we reached the sea where I got on the boat successfully.\n\n\n# Chapter 17\n\n## The new life of Joan and the duke\n\nThe sea was peaceful, and I could hardly feel the waves. The weather was unusually cold for\nConstantinople – the captain was explaining this as the influence of the storm. He was telling us that the\nstorm had crashed many big and small ships, while the boats and the fishermen were still being counted.\n\n“Yes, Lovushka, many of lucky persons were saved in my ship due to the heroic efforts of my\ncrew and boundless courage of yourself and your brother. Now we are admiring this fantastic panorama,”\nhe kept speaking, “but how many people didn’t make it to come here. Well then, how you could guess your\ndestiny an hour ahead and how you could ever tell that you are happy thinking about tomorrow. Hence, I’m\nright by telling you that we are living only once and that we have to live in this moment, to catch that\nhappiness which is flying past us in a twinkling.”\n\n“Yes,” I answered him, “I also was thinking that I had to catch only my personal happiness up\ntill the last moment, but when I got to know my new friends more closely, I understood that happiness to\nlive isn’t hiding in my personal happiness, but in that absolute self-control when man himself is able to\nbring joy and harmony to others. Like you, I. is also talking about the value and meaning to live only in this\nmoment which is flying past us now, but by saying so, he foresees man’s ability to embrace the whole, the\nentire world, all surrounding people, his activity for them and with them by perceiving himself as the little\npart of the entire universe. I still understand him a little and badly, but the new notes have already begun\nto sound within myself, my heart has opened for love widely. I’m feeling as though I had graduated some\nspecial university which helped me to perceive each new day as the whole string of the spiritual\nuniversities. I stopped thinking at all about that what was waiting for me in my life, while earlier I was living\nwith that what would happen in ten years.”\n\n“Yes, Lovushka, my universities are worse than yours,” the captain answered me. “I’m still\nliving in my tomorrow or my past, because my present doesn’t satisfy or fascinate me. Now I’m thinking\nabout Gurzuff tensely and I’m dreaming to meet Lisa. Somehow I cannot estimate the present enough.”\n\nBy taking advantage of the fact that the sailors couldn’t understand French, we continued\nour conversation by interrupting it time and again, because the captain knew the city perfectly and he was\nnaming separate buildings, palaces and mosques to me. I hardly had time to admire them.\n\n```\nWhen our trip on the water was coming to the end, my thoughts came back to Joan again.\n```\n```\n“I still cannot forget your low bow to the great suffering of Joan,” I assented to him.\n```\n“Poor woman, she’s a girl-mother! How many questions she will have to solve for her\nchildren. Educating a man from his very childhood is such an important beginning, and what Joan can give\nto them? She doesn’t know anything herself and she cannot read a single book about education, so that\nshe could understand anything from it,” the captain was speaking to me, lost in thought.\n\n“We also won’t understand much in those books about education if the man who has written\nit would be much more creative than us. Everything depends on those vibrations of man’s heart and\nthoughts, in which he’s living. One can understand only what is close to oneself. There is such general\nlanguage that unites both the Beduin and the European, the Black and the Englishman, the Saint and the\nRobber – that’s the language of love and beauty. Joan is able to love her children; to love them not in a\n\n\nbrutal love as her body and blood by being proud of their advantages or disadvantages, or suffering\nbecause of them,” I interceded for Joan.\n\n“But at the moment, she can love them only as her duty, as the lesson of her life, and lots of\ntime will pass until her consciousness is able to perceive her life as the circumstances which are\nunavoidable, the only ones in the world sent only to her and nobody else. Only then there will be no place\nleft for her grumbling or her tears, but there will be only her joyful work and gratitude,” the captain\nanswered me.\n\nI began to stare intensely at him, having forgotten everything in the world. His face was\ntender, kindness was gushing from his eyes. A charming wave of tenderness extended from my heart\ntowards him.\n\n“You certainly have to meet Florentian,” I mumbled. “At worst, you should at least talk to I.\nseriously. Forgive me, because I’m only the boy in comparison to yourself and your experience, I don’t\nknow anything, but it seems to me that there’s the same mess in your head and your heart as within\nmyself.”\n\n```\nThe captain gave a joyful laugh.\n```\n“Bravo, bravissimo, Lovushka! If there’s a mess within yourself, then there’s the real muddle,\nonly the pap within myself. I’m always searching for an opportunity to talk to your mysterious I. myself, but\nI still have no success. Well, here we are,” he added by ordering the sailors to row to the shore and to stop\nat the end of the pier.\n\nWe got out of the boat and we were climbing up the road to the city with the help of the\nclumsy sailor. Soon we reached the necessary place and we saw from the distance how our entire company\nof friends went inside through the door.\n\nWe caught up with them while they were still in the antechamber. To everyone’s\namazement, the house was well established and furnished. The antechamber was bright and it had a big\nwindow. Judging from its furniture, it was a waiting-room, and the door from it was leading to a big room\nwhich resembled a Turkish sitting-room.\n\nStroganoff was explaining to Joan how he was planning to construct the glass ward-robes for\nreadymade hats, plumes, flowers and bands, so the buyers could see Joan’s aristocratic talent and taste,\nand could instantly choose the item which they liked. There were also the premises behind the big room\nwith two long tables for the studio, and from here one could get to the yard through the porch.\n\nJoan’s children hung on me immediately, but I. forbade me to raise them up. They took\noffence and calmed down only when the clumsy sailor seated both of them on his powerful shoulders and\nwent out to the yard and garden with them. There was a small fountain, and several big Eastern tanks with\nlong narrow mouths were standing there.\n\nHaving examined everything downstairs, we went out to the antechamber once again and\nwent up the winding metal stairs to the second floor.\n\nThere were three little rooms here. One of them was furnished like the dinning-room; two\nnew childish beds and a sofa were standing in the second one; a splendid mirror in the bright frame, a wide\nTurkish sofa and several chairs were standing in the third room.\n\nTears were rolling down Joan’s cheeks. She extended both of her hands towards Stroganoff\nagain and uttered silently.\n\n\n“You taught me perfectly yesterday by saying that that person wins who starts his business\neasily. Today you showed me how really kind you were, how easily you did everything, so that you could\nhelp me to start my business easily. I will never forget your kindness and I will try to show gratitude to you\nwith everything I will be able to. I’m your devoted servant forever now only because of these charming\nchildish little beds, about which I didn’t dare even to dream.”\n\n“Madam, these are only the details. I already wanted to tidy up the house a long time ago,\nbecause as I have already mentioned to you, I was born here and I value it both for my memories and for\nthe lessons of life that I have experienced here. I’m glad of this excellent opportunity to arrange it for\nworking woman and her children. And here’s my daughter,” Stroganoff was speaking to her, while stepping\ntowards a woman who was going upstairs.\n\nA tall woman was standing in front of us. She had muffled herself up in a black silky cloak\nwith the black veil pulled down on her face.\n\n“This is my daughter Anna,” he addressed Joan. “You are Joan, she’s Anna. It would be great\nif you could strike up a friendship, then it would be fascinating in your atelier,” he continued, laughing.\n“Anna in Hebrew means “attractive, fascinating”, right? My beloved, fascinating daughter is very easy to be\ndealt with...”\n\nAnna cast the black veil off her face... me and the captain rooted to the spot from\namazement and fascination: her oval-shaped face with big black eyes was pale, her black plait was\nextending over her shoulders below her waist, her charming mouth was smiling and her teeth were white\nlike the porcelain...\n\nAnna was extending her long and white hand to Joan and speaking to her in a deep, kind and\nsoft voice.\n\n“My father wishes very much that I could learn to work not only with my head, but also with\nmy hands. I’ve been resisting his will for four years, but this time, after I found out that my teacher would\nbe a woman with children, who has experienced a terrible disaster, I agreed easily and with joy, I even\ndidn’t know myself why I did it. I cannot tell that hats or ladies would fascinate me,” Anna continued,\nlaughing, “but some kind of intuition is telling me that I will be useful here.”\n\nHer French language was clean and correct. She took the black cloak off and remained only\nin an ordinary, white, silky, elegant dress and black, patent-leather shoes which were unusually small in\ncomparison to her height.\n\nI don’t know with what – with her long plait, the grace of her figure or some elegance of her\nmanners, - but Anna reminded me of Nal with something. I couldn’t hold out and I began to whisper.\n\n```\n“Nal, Nal.”\n```\n```\n“What’s wrong? What are you speaking here?” the captain asked me silently.\n```\n```\nI. took my arm and asked me, too.\n```\n“Lovushka, what are you whispering here? This isn’t Nal, this is Anna. Come to yourself and\ndon’t disgrace us when she’s introduced to us. Don’t kiss her hand, but wait until she extends it to you\nherself, otherwise you might get scared like you did by meeting Chava,” I. smiled to me.\n\n“Scheherazade! Now my whole life is a fairy-tale, and the women are fairies,” the captain\nwas talking, “but who is that man whom this Pallas Athena has been loving, if she’s still loyal to his\nremembrance? You could give half of your life, so that such woman would love you for at least one night.”\n\n\nAnna’s father was introducing her to everyone who was present here. She was looking\nintently at everyone’s eyes, she was extending her hand to everyone and smiling lightly, but her entire\nattention was focussed on the children who were riding on the clumsy sailor’s shoulders. Anna went up to\nthem by extending her hands towards them. The little ones were looking at her with their eyes opened\nwide. Having touched her plait slightly, the girl asked her.\n\n```\n“Aunt, why are you so black? Have you been painted with the soot?”\n```\n“No,” Anna gave a laugh, “my father gave such black colour of hair to me, but soon I will\nbecome grey, and you will stop being afraid of my plait.”\n\n```\nFinally, it was our turn.\n```\nFirst, the captain was introduced to her. He bowed low and squeezed her extended hand by\nlooking straight into Anna’s face, because this time she was looking down; her cheeks turned slightly red,\nand it seemed to me that even an annoyance flashed in her face.\n\n```\nAnna looked at I. very intently, and her black eyes began to burn like torches.\n```\n“Of course, you are that Ananda’s friend about whom he was writing to me in his last letter?\nI’m glad to meet you. I hope that until Ananda comes here, you will have the honour to visit us at our\nhome.”\n\n```\n“I will be glad to visit you, if your father doesn’t have anything against this,” I. answered her.\n```\n“Do you think that my Turkish appearance has anything to do with the Eastern education? I\ncan assure you that it doesn’t. It’s impossible to find a more understanding and freedom giving father in the\nwhole world. He is the first friend and assistant of both myself and all my sisters and brothers. Everybody of\nus is absolutely free to choose our acquaintances. There’s only one thing that my father doesn’t like – that’s\none’s life without working. In the entire family only I still don’t earn my living, but now I also understand\nthat I have to communicate and unite with people by bringing in help to daily routine according to my\nstrength,” Anna was talking to us by taking an opportunity that her father with Joan kept examining the\nrooms.\n\n“Let me introduce my cousin Lovushka T. to you.” I. told her. “He, just like me, is Ananda’s\nand Florentian’s friend, and he’s thinking about the last one both in the day-time and at night,” I. added by\npushing me forward a little. “Perhaps, you will allow me to visit you with him, because we are almost\ninseparable, especially when Lovushka is a little unwell.”\n\n“I will be glad to see both of you at our place,” Anna answered him pleasantly by extending\nher hand to me, which I squeezed a little.\n\n“Oh, you fell into her hands, young man,” I heard Stroganoff’s voice behind my back. “Anna\nmust have absolutely sensed the writer in you. She’s also a quite good poetess. She’s writing wonderful\nfairy-tales for children, but she doesn’t agree to publish them, but her work is known in Constantinople\nanyway. I bet she has already enslaved you. Only don’t believe her, she’s as though a hard-hearted.”\n\n“Father, you’ve put the young writer to shame so much – if he’s really a writer – that he\nwould certainly avenge you by describing you at least as the celebrity of Constantinople,” Anna gave a\nlaugh in a very melodious voice.\n\nJoan approached her, and both women stepped aside by the window in order to discuss\nsomething. Anna was standing with her profile turned to us, and the eyes of all four men were looking at\nher.\n\n\nI remembered the evening in the odorous garden of Ali, I remembered not so dark Nal’s\nplait, her green eyes and the faces of three men who were looking at her intently, but with different\nexpressions.\n\nIt was the same now – the captain strained his look and he saw only the physical charm of\nher turned forms within her. The expression of the cruel beast of pray which was already well known to me\nwas hiding in his yellow eyes, he strained himself like a sting and reminded me of a tiger that was lurking\nfor the prey.\n\nTenderness and kindness got stiff in I.’s face, he was as though blessing Anna, and the word\n“charming” flashed in my consciousness.\n\nHer father was looking at his daughter with sad and thoughtful eyes, as though he was\nsuffering because of some secret pain of his daughter, but he was unable to do anything about it, no matter\nhow much it was breaking his heart.\n\nI was all burning. Thoughts were flashing in my head, they were bubbling and breaking like\nwaves by hitting one another. I could see Ananda next to the tall figure of Anna in my thoughts and I was\npondering that no one else could ever become her chosen one if she knew such charming and handsome\nman with his eyes-stars closely.\n\nI forgot absolutely everything; I could see only Ananda, I remembered his exceptional voice,\nand all of a sudden that voice was heard in my ears: “Not every love ties human bodies together, but that\nlove which ties their spirit in a slavish way isn’t real, too. Only that love will be real, which will open all\nman’s talents and skills for his creative activity, which will liberate his spirit.”\n\nThe illusion of the sound was so strong that unawares I dashed forward, because I wanted to\nsee Ananda through the window, but the iron I.’s hand was already holding me tightly.\n\n```\nThe captain turned to the noise made by me.\n```\n“Do you feel unwell, Lovushka? You’ve turned so pale! It is stifling here, let’s go home,” he\nwas talking to me by taking my arm from another side and trying to help me out tenderly.\n\n```\nHaving heard these words of the captain, Joan went up to us quickly and told me.\n```\n“Don’t leave, Lovushka,” but, having noticed my paleness, she added silently. “What an\negoist I am! I’m thinking only about myself. You certainly need to go home. Do you feel unwell?”\n\nI was unable to utter a single word, because some sort of a spasm was squeezing my throat.\nI. answered Joan that now the captain would take me home, and in the evening we could have dinner with\nher if she made herself free from her business until seven o’clock. I. himself will help her to settle here if\nshe has nothing against it.\n\nNow the Turks, Stroganoff and Anna who’ve been silent during all this time interfered by\nprotesting categorically against any help of I., by making him sure that everything would be done without\nhim.\n\nWe said good-bye to the whole company and went out to the street, accompanied by the\nclumsy sailor.\n\nI. wanted to accompany me to the boat, but the captain offered him to wait and sit on the\nbench with me for a while until he and the clumsy sailor would arrange one business not far away from\nhere.\n\n\nI was glad that I could sit in the shadow for a while and stay with I. I asked him to give me\none strengthening pill of Ali, but he answered me that in this case no pill would help me.\n\n“Lovushka, there are some people who can see and hear that what thousands of others can\nneither hear nor see such things. They are rewarded with an exceptional power of inner sight and hearing,\nwhich is operating on a totally different frequency of vibrations, which has nothing to do with the\nfrequency with which most people are receiving their impressions and feelings. You possess that gift within\nyourself – to hear and to see through the distance, only you value it like a hallucination of your absent-\nmindedness. If you hadn’t received the blow to your fontanel so untimely, these talents of yours would\nhave developed consistently. In the meanwhile, now your entire organism, your entire spinal cord is shaken\nso much that that still unawaken fire which is living in every man – that hidden reserve power – has forced\nits way through, it destroyed all obstacles on its way by exposing your hidden spiritual powers. When you\nrecover from the concussion, I will explain everything about that what I have just mentioned to you in more\ndetail. I want you to understand that you aren’t ill, you aren’t losing your mind, simply the powers, the\nfrequency of vibrations which are much higher and stronger, it is of another nature than that to which you\nhad been used to up to now, have opened earlier within yourself. Keep your self-control. Lie down for a\nwhile more often and with all your might try not to get irritated. Don’t mention this conversation of ours to\nanyone with a single word,” he added by seeing that the captain and the clumsy sailor were coming back\nalready.\n\nI saw an unusual view and I was unable to understand in any way who was approaching us.\nOnly I. started laughing instantly.\n\n“Congratulations, Lovushka! Now you will be travelling through Constantinople like a beauty\nof a harem.”\n\nFinally, I also could see the big palanquin with the downcast curtains which was carried by\ntwo tall Turks. I was filled with indignation so much, I started stamping my foot with anger so much that I.\nwho was just laughing so joyfully suddenly seized me with his strong hands, seated me and told me very\nstrictly.\n\n“I have just asked you not to get irritated, I warned you how serious the state of your health\nwas. Do really my words and all possibilities of your future mean so little to you? And finally, don’t you have\nany sense of humour?”\n\n“I understand humour and I highly appreciate every possibility to come closer to my\nknowledge, but I absolutely don’t want to be a figure of fun even in the eyes of those sailors who are\ncarrying the stretcher,” I answered him in excitement.\n\n“First of all, control yourself. Feel the great joy to be the master of yourself. Value the efforts\nof the captain, too. Be polite and try to educate yourself in such a way that you could always find a\ngentlemanly expression with which you could cover your feelings even if they are very unpleasant. Search\nfor that tact about which Florentian is talking to you.”\n\n```\nThe procession came nearer. The captain waved his cap joyfully.\n```\n“As you can see, I invented the way how to avoid shaking. This stretcher belongs to one of\nmy legless friend. Mostly he prefers travelling like this. But, oh my God! You feel even worse, Lovushka! You\nwere pale, and now you’re all with red spots,” the captain exclaimed.\n\nI overcame the strong attack of my irritation and I already wanted to thank him for his efforts\nin an emphatically cold and polite way, when I. interfered and addressed the captain very tenderly.\n\n\n“No, captain, Lovushka isn’t feeling any worse. This is still his reaction to the blow, but he will\ngo to the boat on foot with you perfectly. This is even more useful for him now, and if you agreed, it would\nbe the best to send the stretcher with the clumsy sailor to Joan’s children. Joan will have to go to the city to\ndo some business, and the children will be only restricting her. If you agreed to use the stretcher in such a\nway as it seems to me, then I would return to children right away.”\n\n“If you allow Lovushka to go on foot, then I will be glad to let you have this stretcher,” the\ncaptain answered him merrily, not even suspecting what a storm I was experiencing within myself because\nof this care of his.\n\nI. squeezed my hand a little, asked the captain to put me to bed as soon as we return and\nalso added that he would be back at six o’clock and, if I stayed in bed calmly during the whole day, he\nwould take me to the duke’s.\n\nWe said good-bye to I. and went towards the boat. I was glad of getting rid of that idiotic\npalanquin, but an annoyance by myself and the captain was still boiling within myself.\n\n“I don’t understand what kind of men are living in Constantinople,” the captain was talking\nas though to himself. “If such a woman like Anna is still free, then not the blood, but water is flowing in the\nveins of the local men. She would have already had time to marry somebody two or even three times in\nEngland, and at least ten duels would have taken place for her. She’s an incredible beauty, isn’t she?”\n\n“I know a little about the womanly beauty,” I answered him, “but I think that Anna is indeed\na rare beauty. I think that the men who haven’t enslaved her heart aren’t to blame, because only those\nwomen can be enslaved who want it. Men are courting and fighting only for those women who are trying\nto present themselves in a more useful and favourable way. Such women like Anna are searching for the\nreal love, they always choose the most modest path if their talents or ambitions don’t betray them.”\n\n```\nThe captain even stopped – he was so amazed by my thoughts.\n```\n“Well, that’s Lovushka! Well, this is how you put it!” the captain was throwing up his arms.\n“How old are you then? Fifty or twenty? Where have you had time to draw such conclusions?”\n\n“I don’t understand, why are you so amazed? It seems to me that my uttered words are the\nsimplest. In Russia we have lots of wonderful women without any coquetry, and the admirers are choosing\nnot the most beautiful, but the most coquettish, right? My brother used to repeat this alphabetical truth to\nme in every right moment.”\n\n```\nWe were deep in our own thoughts and kept silent during the rest of the way.\n```\nHaving reached the hotel, we felt that we were hungry, so we ordered a light breakfast\nwhich I was eating in bed. After the breakfast, the captain lit up a cigar and returned to Anna once again.\n\n“It is so strange,” he uttered. “I would really give a lot if I could love such goddess like Anna\nfor a while. Namely only for a while, absolutely not imagining that I could be her husband or a constant\nknight. Something is hiding within her, which would hinder me to come even nearer to her.”\n\n“For me Anna is distinguished for her spiritual culture. If you are still not leaving\nConstantinople soon, then you will meet one of I.’s friends who is also close to Anna at the same time. If\nshe loves him even without his response, then nobody could ever compete with him and turn her attention\nto him. The eyes of that man are shining like the stars, while his voice enslaves one only while he’s talking.\nIt is impossible to forget him if you see or hear him just once, and people say that he’s singing like a God.” I\nanswered him.\n\n\n“How can you know what is drawing one man to another? Anna could be a distinct episode\nof my life, but never my epoch. But if life brought me together with the girl Lisa again, then she could\nprobably become my epoch.”\n\n```\nI started remembering Lisa, her manners, speech and I asked him.\n```\n“And what is your opinion about a wife artiste? How would you estimate her talent in a\ngeneral way? People say that Lisa is exceptionally talented, don’t they, and you have so many superstitions.\nHow would you feel setting in the front row of the concert hall, while your wife violinist would be playing\nthe violin?”\n\n“I have never thought that the stage or the place behind the scenes could play any part in my\nlife at all. I was always avoiding the women from the theatre. All of them seemed to me to be soaked with\nsocial climbing and a desire to sell themselves as costly as possible.”\n\n“But haven’t you met a single woman during your entire pithy life, who was really dedicated\nto the art, who didn’t have another life without that art to which she was serving, which she was\nbreathing?” I was asking the captain again.\n\n“No, I haven’t met one,” he answered me. “I knew some so called great actresses, but none\nof them seemed to have the divine gift of talent. I knew some high culture artists, and it seemed to them\nthat the secrets of nature had already opened up to them, but... they turned out to be absolutely shallow in\ntheir everyday life.”\n\nIn this way our meeting was finished, because several business visits and work were waiting\nfor the captain on the steamer, and in the evening he also wanted to go to see his friends. We said good-\nbye to each other until tomorrow.\n\nI took a nap, because I was tired of today’s meetings and I woke up only from I.’s voice that\nwas waking me up loudly. He was hurrying me to change my clothes, to take the first-aid kit and to go to\nthe duke.\n\nHe gave me some bitter drops to drink. I was soon ready, and we went to the duke’s villa on\nfoot, which was not far away at all. I was very interested in this meeting. Although his old wife seemed to\nbe very wicked to me, anyway I was feeling a pity for her, for her nearing death and for her stiff body.\n\nUnawares, I started thinking how it was difficult for every man to die: “And what Florentian\nwas thinking about death? How was he going to die himself?” And all of a sudden, in the middle of the day,\nin the continuous noise and uproar of the street I heard his voice: “There’s no death. There’s only life – the\nonly one, everlasting, and there are many of its external forms.” I stopped dead, and if I. hadn’t given a pull\nat me, I would have gotten under the wheels of the coach.\n\n```\n“Lovushka, I simply cannot let you alone to take a single step,” he told me by taking my arm.\n```\n“Yes, Lolion, you cannot leave me alone,” I was complaining to him in a plaintive voice. “The\ndamn fist of the Turk has turned me into a madman. I’m making progress to madness so much that I cannot\nstop. The hallucinations keep growing stronger.”\n\n```\n“Not at all, Lovushka. Only today you were very irritated. What has excited you now?”\n```\n“A thought occurred to me with what difficulty the old duchess was dying. I thought for a\nwhile how it was terrible and not easy for everybody to die. I only thought what Florentian was thinking\nabout death, and suddenly I heard his voice: “There’s no death. There’s only life – the only one, everlasting,\n\n\nand there are many of its external forms.” Isn’t this the absurdity that I started to hear?” I kept complaining\nto I.\n\n“My friend, you’ve heard the great wisdom. I will explain everything to you later. We are\ncoming nearer to our goal. Forget yourself and your state. Think only about those unfortunate persons\nwhom we are visiting. Think about Florentian, about his bright love for man. Try to see the Florentian’s goal\nwithin the duke and his wife, try to bring in that peace and light to this house, which is pulsating in the\nheart of your great friend. Think only about him and about them, and not about yourself, then you could be\nmy loyal and useful assistant in this house. Then it will be easy here for both of us.”\n\nWe entered the duke’s house that was surrounded by the shady garden. The housemaid met\nus, whom we already knew, because she was cruising with them on the steamer. She told us that the\nduchess was still as though sleeping, while the duke was waiting for us impatiently.\n\nWe crossed several absolutely empty rooms and heard the quick steps following us. The\nduke caught up with us.\n\n“I’m so glad that you came,” he addressed I. “I’m so worried about the duchess’ condition\nthat I was already ready to go to you. I need both your help and your advice myself no less than my wife,”\nhe continued by smiling sincerely and squeezing our hands.\n\n“Why are you so worried about the duchess? I have warned you, haven’t I, that her returning\nto life would be very slowly and that she would be sleeping most of the time.”\n\n“Yes, I remember all of that – and it is very strange for myself – I believe your every word\nunconditionally and completely. Even the very belief in you is somehow special, incomparable with\nanything,” the duke was speaking in his silent and musical voice by letting us pass the third room in a row,\nwhich was furnished a little and reminded of a study.\n\nHe pulled the chairs to the table for us, sat down himself on the Eastern style stool and\ncontinued.\n\n“I wouldn’t be talking to you about my state if it didn’t seem to be so strange to me. Now the\nfeeling of belief in you gives me strength to live. As though some power had flowed into my spine and held\nmy entire body on its strong axis by forming the basis of my self-control. As soon as I imagine that you will\nleave soon – the whole power disappears, and I’m feeling helpless before the nearing difficulties of life.”\n\n“Don’t worry, dear duke,” I. told him. “First of all, we aren’t leaving so soon, and second – my\ngood friend will come here with his close disciple and friend who has already graduated all medical\nsciences. Both of them will help you, too. Maybe that friend of ours, the young doctor, will even stay with\nyou for longer. As you can see, sometimes the destiny takes a very good care of us.”\n\n“I cannot describe how I’m moved of your kindness, and most importantly – of that simplicity\nand easiness which are leading your actions, that everybody can accept all your greatest services as easy as\nif it was a trifle.”\n\n```\nHaving lit up his cigarette and kept silent, the duke continued.\n```\n“My state worries me. My wife’s son must come here to meet his mother. He wants to\nreceive a part of his property now, while she’s still alive. I was hoping very much from this meeting, thinking\nthat the division of the property done now by my wife herself would liberate me from many trials and\nsuffering after her death. That son of hers, although he’s a famous general, although he occupies a high\npost in the czar’s palace, - he’s a greedy liar, a selected crook and he loves to litigate. Namely today I\n\n\nreceived the telegram that he wouldn’t come, but he would send two of his lawyers with full warrants of\nattorney from Moscow. You can imagine what a horror will be here when those two dandies come here\nand find my wife who will only mumble obscurely, who won’t be able to use neither her hands nor her\nlegs...”\n\n“I have already told you,” I. interrupted the duke, “that your wife’s speech and hands would\nrecover pretty soon. Unfortunately, she probably won’t be able to use her legs until she dies, but her death\nitself won’t happen soon as well. Her heart is very strong, so you will have to take pains over tending her\nfor two or even more years. Don’t look at this perspective menacing to you like a punishment. The great\nand wise life doesn’t recognize any punishments. It gives an opportunity for each man to mature and gain\nstrength in exactly such circumstances which are needed for everybody personally – and only to him alone.\nIn this case you should think not about yourself, but only about your wife. Try to open her eyes with your\nkindness from the bottom of your heart. Explain to her that there’s no death, exactly as there’s no a\nseparate and only earthly life. Only an eternal, the only one life of heaven and earth exists for common\nwelfare – the spiritual life of light and joy, which is tied in the human bodies made of hard and solid earthly\nmatter. And the whole man’s life on earth isn’t only a final existence from his birth till his death, it is the\nwhole string of his existences, the string of his visible material forms; in them there’s always the only one,\neternal life which is unchangeable, and it is changing only its relative, temporary earthly forms. If you are\ninterested in this, we can still analyse this endless subject many times. Now I would like you to perceive the\ngrandeur and meaning of each man’s earthly life, to understand how clearly he should see everything both\ninside and outside of him; what a power is hiding in everybody if he has already learnt to control himself, if\nhe is able – during the only one moment that has opened up to his knowledge – to forget himself like a\ntemporary form and to find the boundless love within himself, so that with its help he could bring help of\npeace into another heart. Let’s go to visit your wife. From now on you will have to become her devoted and\ncompassionate servant. Soon I will be able to tell you when she begins to recover, then she can spend her\ndays in the arm-chair.”\n\nWith these words I. stood up. I was devouring his every word attentively by trying not to miss\nany of it, but all of it was so new and unexpected to me that I didn’t understand anything fully and I\ncouldn’t put all of it into a logical chain of thoughts. From the perplexed face of the duke I decided that he\nalso hadn’t understood much more than I had, although he was listening for I.’s words in some respectful\necstasy.\n\n```\nI and the duke stood up, too, and the three of us went to the duchess’s room.\n```\nHow this room was different from what we had seen in the hospital’s cabin when the captain\nordered to open it during the scandal. The windows were fully opened, the curtains were drawn, so there\nwas a dusk. There were many flowers delivered, they smelt wonderfully, and the order was simply\nexemplary.\n\nThe duchess was lying on a high, excellent bed, dressed with a beautiful, batiste robe. The\ntrained nurse was sitting next to her, she stood up in order to meet us.\n\nThe duchess turned her head towards the sound of the steps. That meaningless and idiotic\nexpression had already been gone from her face, only the bruise was still left around her mouth.\n\nOne could feel consciousness in her eyes which were fastened upon I. She was trying to raise\nher hand, but only a spasm ran through her body from those efforts. She fixed her gaze on the duke\npleadingly, and the tears came pouring from her eyes on her flabby and pale cheeks.\n\n```\nThe duke went up to the bed, lifted his wife’s lifeless hand, kissed it and asked her.\n```\n\n```\n“My dear, do you want to greet the doctor?”\n```\nThis time the patient’s lips smiled a little, I. went up to her and took that absolutely dead\nhand from the duke.\n\n“Duchess, don’t make any efforts,” I. was talking to her while he was feeling her pulse.\n“Everything is all right. Danger doesn’t threaten you anymore, and if you are following my instructions\ncarefully during the day and night, I guarantee that your hands will recover completely, that your memory\nand your speech will come back entirely. However, you will have to learn self-control and patience. You\ndidn’t know what self-control was during your entire life, so now you’ve reached such a sad end. Stop\ncrying. Now you certainly need to accumulate all your thoughts not only to your wish to recover, but you\nalso have to try to make the people that are near you happy, joyful and satisfied. Only the atmosphere that\nwill be filled only with your joy and peace can help me to cure you. If your thoughts and feelings will be\nradiating anger or irritation, I will be helpless to help you. You have to unite with everybody who will be\nclose to you with love and benevolently.”\n\nThe streams of tears kept rolling down the old woman’s face, which the duke who was totally\nconfused was wiping carefully. All of a sudden the words “forgive me” in a wild, horrible and whistling voice\nslipped off her lips which were always trying to say something. These words – like the sound of a broken\nstring – flashed across the air, and then a deadly silence followed. I felt the well-known nausea and\ndizziness instantly. I. put his arms round my shoulders and whispered.\n\n```\n“Be strong. Think about Florentian! Call him to help you.”\n```\nIt was silent in the room for some time. I. was standing next to the duchess, still holding her\nhand. Her face was calming down little by little, her eyes got dry, and she already looked like a living\nperson, not like the horrible mask pulled by the spasms.\n\nI. told me to take a couple of medicine from the first-aid kit. He mixed them and melted the\nred powder from his bottle in them. I had never seen this bottle up to now, and it seemed to be golden to\nme. The liquid began to boil, and its colour turned into bright red. I lifted the duchess’ head a little, and I.\ngave her the medicine to drink carefully.\n\nFinally, the duchess swallowed the last drop of the medicine, drew a sigh of relief, closed her\neyes and fell into a light slumber. Having warned the trained nurse that the patient may be sleeping even\nfor the next twenty-four hours, we left the room.\n\n```\nWe returned to the duke’s study, sat down on our previous places, and I. continued.\n```\n“Duke, I should like to ask you a favour. You are always trying to show gratitude for me and\nmy brother for the help provided to your wife.”\n\n“Oh, you are helping not only my wife, but you’ve become the new meaning of my life for\nmyself, too. I was already considering my life to be ruined,” the duke exclaimed. “You even don’t know\nwhat flight of imagination made me to marry my current wife. I was imagining that I was saving her from a\nthousand of her new mistakes. I didn’t save her from any of them, I only understood that I was weak and in\nthis way I found myself into this misfortunate situation of contempt. You don’t know...”\n\n“I know,” I. interrupted him, “I know that you are noble, very honourable and very kind man.\nNow I want to address exactly this kindness of yours. You’ve probably heard that we and the captain helped\none poor French woman with two children to reach Constantinople. She was expecting to find her relatives\nhere, but I think that she would fail to do it. We’re leaving her under protection of one wonderful family\nhere, but the poor lady is so young, so unexperienced and so ill-bred that, of course, she will create lots of\n\n\ndifficulties for herself, which she could hardly overcome. Her character is very quick-tempered and\npeppery, while your tact and kindness could help in her life very much. Soon we’ll leave. You will have to\nspend here up to two years, because to move for your wife would mean death. If you agree, let’s come to\nvisit Joan Moranjer. We will introduce you to her, and I can be calm that Joan will have a reliable and noble\nguardian.”\n\n“I will be happy with the possibility to show gratitude somehow to the madam Joan,” the\nduke answered him, “but I have so little self-confidence myself and I experience parting with you so\npainfully. I’m ready to visit her right this moment. I will try to see only her heart within her, to which I must\nrender all gratitude that I feel for you, and I will bring all my devotion to you into her heart.”\n\nWe said good-bye to the duke and agreed to visit Joan tomorrow at noon, after visiting his\nwife.\n\nWe came back home, and I was so tired that I went to bed immediately, because I couldn’t\nperceive anything anymore. All my thoughts interlaced, and I didn’t even remember how I fell asleep.\n\nI heard the knocking at my door on rather late morning of the next day, and the sonorous\nvoice of the captain was shaming me for such laziness.\n\n“I have already done a hundred of workings. My steamer has already been brought to the\ndock for repairs, the sun has already had time to heat the streets, while you, the great man of the future,\nare still sleeping! I’m hungry like a gun dog. Lovushka, get up quickly, I will order the breakfast, we will wipe\nit out in your balcony if, of course, you admit me to your company,” the captain was talking loudly behind\nthe door.\n\nI answered him that I agreed, I dashed to the bath quickly, and we were already sitting at the\ntable in a quarter of an hour.\n\nI. had left not leaving any note for me, and I understood that he would be back soon. And so\nit was, soon I heard his steps, and he came to the balcony himself, somehow especially radiating with\nfreshness and beauty. Having greeted us, he asked the captain about the steamer’s destiny.\n\nThe captain’s face frowned. It turned out that the steamer was in need of serious repairs;\nthis delay when the big part of the travellers and freight had to continue their route gave him lots of\nworries and difficulties.\n\n“But your nearness, doctor I., is very dear to me. I value the meeting with you as the most\nimportant event of my life and I’m ready to overcome even greater difficulties only if I could stay with you\nfor longer, if this doesn’t cause you any trouble,” the captain finished his sentence in an absolutely silent\nvoice by looking at I. sadly.\n\nHe already wasn’t that strong-willed captain, he wasn’t that “God and the Master” of his ship\nanymore, in front of whom the whole ship’s crew and the travellers were trembling. I saw the totally\ndifferent side of the man’s soul once again and I made sure again what an immeasurable difference was\nbetween that what you could see and that what was hiding within a man.\n\n“I’m also glad that we met, dear captain,” I. answered him, “and communicating with you\nisn’t causing any trouble for me – on the contrary, I feel a great brotherly friendship for you in my heart.\nToday I received some excellent news both from Lovushka’s brother and from my close friend Ananda for\nwhom I wasn’t expecting here so soon. Lovushka, your brother and Nal got married in London at the\npresence of Florentian and his friends, while Ananda should be here no later than in ten days. Captain, I\nwish very much that your troubles would still detain you in Constantinople. Ananda surpasses any man so\n\n\nmuch that even meeting him, even understanding what a man who is made from the same body and blood\nlike is able to achieve on earth would lift you up to the higher level of ideas in comparison to the one on\nwhich you are living today. I can see lots of questions within your soul, and you have even more of them\nevery time when we meet. If we could lay out your spirit’s bubbling in a literary form, we could make not\nonly selected works of your questions and answers, but even a serial “The daily reader”. All these questions\nof yours are concentrating within you only because I haven’t reached such heights of spirit and knowledge\nas Ananda. The typical sign of the real wise man showing himself in the people masses – the string of\nquestions isn’t growing any longer, but disappearing. Not an activity of mind is growing in people’s\nconsciousness, but their intuition. The subconscious harmonizes the work of their hearts and minds,\nbecause the vanity and illusion of their own achievements and desires opens up for everybody in the\natmosphere of the wise man. I’m sure that your meeting with Ananda will destroy the entire caravan of\ncaste and national prejudices within yourself. There are so many true values and real beauty within yourself\nthat neither your friends from your surroundings nor other acquaintances of yours can be equal to you.”\n\nThe captain’s cigarette went out, he didn’t finish his wine and he was sitting motionless, as\nthough hypnotized, staring at the charming I.’s face. Only the city noise and the scattered guttural cries of\nthe Eastern carriers could be heard in the established silence.\n\nEvery one of us immersed in himself, we didn’t want to disturb the silence and, apparently,\nevery one of us was trying to imagine the wise man in his own way.\n\n“Well, if you are talking about another man like this, you who are the highest man that I have\never met, then what kind of a man should be that Ananda of yours?” the captain was rubbing his forehead\nand kept speaking in the same silent voice.\n\nI wanted to tell him that I have seen even a higher man than Ananda, my friend Florentian,\nbut all of a sudden I felt that special lightness in my whole body, that concentration of my entire attention\ninto one spot which was always accompanied by the hearing of the voice or seeing of the scene of the man\nwho really wasn’t present next to me.\n\nSuddenly my body began to tremble, as though an electric current had run through it, and I\nsaw Ananda who was sitting at the table in the same posture like that night in his home. “Don’t be afraid\nand don’t worry. I. has forgotten neither Florentian nor sir Vomi, but now there’s no need to talk about\nthem. Try to keep silent for as much as possible. The value of a word is so big that sometimes an untimely\nuttered word could make the whole ring of people to perish. Wait for my arrival and we will talk.” Now\nwhen I’m telling you about this, everything seems to be long-winded, but then it flashed with lightning\nspeed.\n\nI extended my hands towards Ananda, I even must have said something to him, because the\ncaptain got next to me in a flash and he was stretching out the glass of wine to me.\n\n```\n“My poor boy! Do you have a headache again?” he asked me tenderly.\n```\nI. also went up to me and smiled; and I understood from his sparkling eyes that he knew the\nreal cause of my anxiety.\n\nThis imaginary ailment of mine distracted the captain’s attention from our conversation.\nHaving stayed for several minutes more, the captain ran out to put many of his affairs in order. Since he\nwas occupied in the evening, we agreed to meet tomorrow, at five o’clock. He wanted to take me to some\nfamous confectionery “Bagdad” very much. He was trying to persuade me that I would see the surprises\nwhich would surpass even a living black woman there. I agreed with everything, because I wanted to stay\nalone with I. as soon as possible and to hear from him about my brother and Nal in more details.\n\n\nHaving seen off the captain, I. came back to me in the balcony and sat down next to me on\nthe couch, because I was still lying down and I was really feeling unwell.\n\n“My dear friend, you will be disappointed, because I also know about your brother and Nal\nonly as much as I have already told you. In general, Ananda doesn’t like speaking much, and this time he\nparticularly reconsidered every word sent to us. You look like as though you had been disappointed in their\nfulfilled marriage?” I. asked me.\n\n“No, I’m not disappointed,” I answered him, “but if my brother’s and Nal’s happiness is in\ntheir marriage, then the goal of their lives – which is the most important for them now – has already been\nachieved. However, I was expecting for something more important, more significant than an ordinary\nmarriage from this entire situation.”\n\nUnexpectedly, I. gave a joyful laugh, embraced me, stroked my unwise head tenderly and\ntold me.\n\n“Where did you get it from, my dear philosopher, that marriage was such an ordinary and\nabsolutely insignificant matter? The marriage depends on the people who get married. Marriages may have\nan exceptional meaning and touch not only those people who get married. Each marriage, a future birth\nand education of people in a new cell of society – family – is an exceptionally important and responsible\nmatter. If the people – future fathers and mothers – have risen to a comprehension of themselves as the\nonly one little parts of the whole universe, if their working day ties in the unified activity of all people with\nits beauty, then they are prepared to educate their new lives, too; they will be introducing this new\ncomprehension by educating them not with their words, but by implanting a beauty with their living\nexample in their children. If they have risen to the great heights of creativity, then they form such cells of\nsociety with their marriage, in which the future famous people, creators and genii may be incarnated,\nwhose inspiration gives a name to the entire epochs of life of mankind.\n\nHarmony of a family – that’s not the same way of thinking of all its members, not their\navailable or unavailable interdependent secrets. That’s the love which is being raked up in a majestic way;\nhere no one is demanding any obligation from anybody, everything is soaked in nobleness, there’s no even\ntalking about selflessness here, but only thoughts about help, about joy to be helpful exist. Lovushka, all of\nthis has caused only the flood of questions for you, but I have already told you: Ananda will come and he\nwill awaken the creative spirit in you, and not the Niagara Falls which are running in question marks. You\nstill must reconsider only one thing very much: the snake of jealousy has fluttered in your heart not for the\nfirst time already. One cannot even imagine the greater horror than life that is poisoned with the attacks of\njealousy.\n\nEven if your daily routine is diluted with jealousy, you can poison both the life of yourself and\nyour beloved ones, and even the whole long life may lose its meaning. You can possess a great talent, you\ncan lead mankind to new distances of literature, music, arts and at the same time, you can make such an\niron cage of passions in your personal life that the entire centuries will be needed until you are able to\nclean out those toadstools and mould from your spirit, which you have grown with your jealous family life.\nAnd on the contrary – one man’s day lived in peace and harmony flies over him like a purifying atmosphere\nthrough the entire centuries, like an invisible assistance and his protection.\n\nToday you shouldn’t reflect on your brother’s marriage. Still much water will have flowed\nunder the bridges until you understand the great meaning of his life, until you can penetrate into his\nspiritual world. He was only a tender, loving nurse, a teacher, a father for you up to now, wasn’t he?\n\n\nGet up, my friend. Here’s a half of Ali’s pill for you. Let’s go to the duke whom we have\npromised to introduce to Joan today. When you are thinking about your brother, believe that he was\nunable to behave neither light-mindedly nor sacrifice himself for saving Nal’s life. This marriage is one of\nthe most important moments of his life. You must respect and even glorify it.”\n\n```\nI took my pill, took the first-aid kit and followed I. in silence.\n```\nWe found the same oppressive atmosphere in the duke’s house. While the duke was\naccompanying us to his wife’s room, he was telling us about her efforts to smile and talk. It was a real\ntorture for everyone to see these efforts, besides she didn’t make any progress.\n\n“Good afternoon, duchess!” I. greeted her. He bent over the tortured, old, withered face of\nthe patient; while she was lying like a heavy, decrepit mass among the wonderful, fragrant flowers.\n\nThe duchess opened her eyes with difficulty, but having seen I., she changed completely.\nConsciousness lit up in her eyes, her lips smiled without any grimace.\n\n“You are doing perfectly. I’m very contented with you,” I. was talking to her by taking her\nhand. “We could even draw a part of the curtain and let some sunshine into the room,” he addressed the\ntrained nurse.\n\nWhen the sun lit up the room, I was surprised how carefully and with what taste it was\nfurnished. It seemed that having forgotten his study which was furnished only Gods knew how, the duke\nfocussed all his attention to this room, so that he could ease the patient’s suffering. How high the inner\nculture of this man had to be if he was wasting his kindness and care for the half-dead body of his terrible\nwife.\n\nCould I ever reach such a level that, having forgotten all bitterness and humiliation of our\njoint life, I could care so much for my wife who had poisoned my young life so much?\n\nI shuddered even to think of what an existence the duke’s life had turned into. My thoughts\nled me out of reality. Lovushka – the catcher of the crows was sitting next to I. instead of an attentive\nassistant of the doctor. I came to myself only when I. touched me. He was looking at me with a reproach.\n\n“Lovushka, the duke is standing in front of you with the glass of water for several minutes\nalready and waiting for an Ali’s pill. In this way we will be delayed here for a long time, and Joan will\nbecome wax angry at the mister young doctor for his being late again,” I. was talking to me and smiling only\nwith his lips, while his eyes were looking straight at me attentively and strictly.\n\nI blushed and thought that once again he read all my thoughts while I was rummaging in the\nduke’s life.\n\nIn several minutes I. gave the patient the red bubbling medicine to drink, he told all\ninstructions to the trained nurse, and together with the duke we left his house.\n\nIt wasn’t very far to reach Joan’s house, but there was simply an unbearable heat in the city\ncompared to the cool of the duke’s shady garden. Although we were walking along the central streets, they\nwere dirty and smelling bad. The dust was making my throat smart and I always wanted to cough.\n\nFinally we entered Joan’s house and we got straight into the surroundings of a merry scurry,\nwork and childish laughter.\n\n\nWe could hardly recognize the flat. Yesterday the antechamber was still empty, and now an\nexcellent wooden rack was already standing across the whole wall. There was a mirror, little table and high\nchairs placed next to another wall.\n\nGlass cupboards and elegant counters were being mounted in the shop. Boris Fyodorovich\nhimself was a chief for everything, consulting Joan and his wonderful daughter Anna. Only one couldn’t feel\nany joint “charm” in today’s job.\n\nThe wonderful face of Anna reminded me of an icon – there was so much tenderness and\nkindness in it. I couldn’t even imagine such a divinity and simply inhuman kindness in this pale face that was\ncovered with the halo of her bluish black plait.\n\nBut Joan... she was sullen, as though unhappy with something, she could hardly utter any\nwords through her teeth by answering Stroganoff. I couldn’t bear anymore, I turned straight to her and I\nwas feeling as though I would attack a bear with only a club in my hands.\n\n“So here’s how “easily” you start your business! So you disgrace I. so much with your ill\nbreeding out of your gratitude to him? Smile as quickly as possible and try to be as kind as possible to these\nwonderful people, and you should be especially polite to that new friend whom I. has brought to you now,”\nI pattered everything straight into her eyes in French, like from a revolver.\n\nJoan must have waited for me to come to her and greet her tenderly, now she was looking at\nme with her misty eyes. Not allowing her to recollect herself, I pattered one more French series to her.\n\n“Control yourself as quickly as possible. Remember the steamer and the hold from which we\ndragged you out. We didn’t return you back to life so that you would demonstrate your poor character, did\nwe? Where did your promises to think about your children disappear?”\n\n“Lovushka, you are dissatisfied with me? But you were gone for so long! Everyone is strange\nto me here, it is so horrible and sad for me,” Joan was mumbling, while her face simply seemed to be\nchildishly helpless.\n\n“Strange!” I gave a shout with indignation. “But you are blind! Look at Anna’s face – which\nmother could radiate more love and kindness? Wipe your eyes immediately and give a pleasant smile to the\nnew friend, because I see that I. is already coming here with him.”\n\n“If you knew that this new friend is not anybody else, but the husband of the duchess who\nwas persecuting you in the steamer!” I thought for myself exactly at that moment when I. introduced the\nduke to Joan. The whole comedy of this acquaintance manifested itself so clearly in my imagination that I\ncouldn’t bear anymore and I was rocking with my urchin laughter.\n\n“Oho!” I heard Stroganoff laughing. “We aren’t in the steamer, and as though the storm isn’t\nmenacing, but it seems that the brave writer is declaring the danger in the style that is characteristic only to\nhim.”\n\n```\nI couldn’t stop laughing in any way, even Anna laughed in her deep and ringing laughter.\n```\n“I will still have a serious talk to that captain,” finally I answered Stroganoff. “He’s making a\nreputation for me, which absolutely isn’t true. I’m especially ashamed of it before you, Anna Borisovna.”\n\n“Why do I make you feel shy so much?” Anna asked me silently and tenderly, while helping\nher father to put the chairs.\n\n\n“That isn’t the right word. You don’t make me feel shy, I respect you very much. I saw a\nperfectly furnished room in B. not so long time ago. I imagined that some higher beings should live in it. I\nthink that you would be in your place in that room,” I answered her.\n\n“Well, what a writer! He knew how to enslave the old father’s heart for ages! You haven’t yet\nhad such a passionate admirer, Anna,” Stroganoff gave a shout.\n\n“Allow me to take out one capable of working member of your atelier for a half of hour,” I\nheard I.’s voice. “If you don’t mind, I and Joan will take a walk in the garden. By the way, let me introduce\none of our friends to you,” he addressed the father and his daughter by letting the duke go forward.\n\nAnna was looking intently at the duke’s eyes, who was completely confused of meeting such\na beauty. She smiled, extended her hand to him and told him tenderly.\n\n“I’m pleased to meet one of I.’s friends. I will be glad to see you in our home if you wish to\nvisit our family.”\n\n“Doctor I. called me one of his friends out of his infinite kindness. For him I’m only the first\nperson whom he met. He has poured me over with his favours, and I haven’t yet repaid him for all that\nhelp, but if you allow an ordinary and weak mortal to be next to you one day – I will be happy to. It seems\nto me that you, just as doctor I., give people strength and self-confidence.”\n\n“You are absolutely right,” Stroganoff answered him. “Anna isn’t only my daughter, but also\na friend and the meaning of my entire life. I will be glad to see you at any time. I and Anna are spending our\nevenings at home and almost always just the two of us. Our family is big, and everybody loves to have a\ngood time. Only I and this nun of mine are always sitting at home.”\n\nI., the duke and Joan with her children went out to the garden. I wanted to follow them, but\nas though a longing or a boredom made me stop and I sat down on the chair which somebody had left in\nthe dark corner behind the cupboard.\n\nStroganoff and Anna were talking in the antechamber, I almost couldn’t hear them, but then\nthe door slammed and they went to the room.\n\n“Why are you so sad, Annushka? Perhaps, it is difficult for you to get down to business,\nbecause your soul is woven into arts? But what could we do, my child? You know how ill I am, don’t you? I\ncan die at any moment. I will be at ease if I leave you provided with some independent work. You don’t\nwant to write for the press. You don’t want to play in public. Only those two talents might provide for your\nlife, right? The earth requires work from us – unskilled or privileged, - therefore, if you don’t want to serve\nit with arts for money, you need to get down to a trade.\n\nBut maybe I made a mistake by offering the companion for you? I thought that the disaster\nwhich Joan has experienced would urge her to work and she would appreciate you properly, but it seems\nthat I made a mistake,” Stroganoff was talking to Anna, it seemed that they continued their started\nconversation.\n\nI wanted to give them a sign that I could hear everything, I wanted to stand up and go out of\nmy corner, so that I wouldn’t become an unwanted witness of the strange secrets, but an apathy, a\ndrowsiness and irresistible doze took hold of me so much that I couldn’t move.\n\n“No, father, I’m not sad. On the contrary, thank you very much for this meeting. My role is\nabsolutely clear next to these wonderful, but neglected children. Their mother adore them, but it seems\nthat her kisses and claps are the only system of her education, her only duty. You know well that I will\n\n\nnever have my own family. I will be an aunt-nurse for them, until...” her voice trembled a little, she was\nsilent for a while, “until I leave for India where I will be learning a lot next to Ananda’s friends, but I have\nalready promised you that this will happen only after your death.”\n\nI didn’t see Stroganoff, but I could feel with my entire being that there were tears in his eyes.\nAnd I wasn’t wrong, because when I heard his voice again, it was through tears.\n\n“Just think! How much beauty, how many talents you’ve got! What a mind, what a heart, and\nall of it must die, not reaching neither the earth nor people.”\n\n“Just on the contrary, father. Since I love people, I want to work for them from the bottom of\nmy heart. I want to be absolutely free, not tied up with any personal bonds. I don’t want to choose people\nfor myself according to my taste, but I want to serve those suffering people whom life will bring to me. In\nthis case your loving hand has given that meeting and those people to me, who may need me the most. It\nwon’t be difficult for me with Joan, because she’s still a child, although the age difference between us isn’t\ngreat.\n\nYou were in my life, while she was educated by the greedy French farmers. And you,\nalthough you were laughing at my attraction to India and my searching for some higher wisdom of life –\nyou are the most striking example of that person whom people call the great blessed.\n\nNot knowing anything and absolutely not wishing to know anything about any “blessings”,\nyou were showing me an example of the active kindness during your entire life. You haven’t gone past a\nman by not giving all your attention to him, not thinking what you could do for him. You used to help\npeople, not waiting for them to ask you for your help.\n\nI was following and I am following in your footsteps with my loyalty to those precepts which I\ncan see in your activities. I know how difficult for you my love for Ananda is, which even seems for you to\nbe without any response and killing me. Understand me now and forever. I’m talking about it for the first\ntime during my entire life, but this time will also be the last one.\n\nThat love has brought not an undergoing, but a rebirth for me; not death, but life; not\nmisery, but happiness. I understood the whole meaning of love when you aren’t asking anything for\nyourself, but you give everything and you don’t impoverish your spirit by doing so, but you become\nstronger.\n\n```\nThat highest selflessness in which Ananda is living isn’t already an ordinary human creativity\n```\n- that’s the power of pure spirit, the spirit that is capable of turning every man’s daily routine into a shining\nreality.\n\nAnd if you have created the joyful and happy life for me next to you, then he has taught me\nto value every moment of my life as the greatest wealth, when all man’s strength must be dedicated not to\nlive an egoistic happiness, but to work for all people’s welfare. I’m walking my path easily, simply, joyfully,\nbeing free and loving.”\n\nThere were voices heard in the porch, their conversation stopped. Joan entered the room,\nthe duke and I. followed her. The duke was cheerful, and Joan didn’t look gloomy anymore. She started\nplacing small boxes joyfully.\n\nThere came a knock at the door, everyone pricked up one’s ears, I took advantage of this\nmoment and slipped off into the garden.\n\n\nI heard somebody calling me in several minutes, but instead of coming back inside, I stole\ninto the furthermost corner of the garden.\n\nSoon I saw the duke among the trees. He had a letter in his hands. He was searching for me\nby addressing me “Lovushka”, because he probably didn’t know my patronymic. I also didn’t know even his\nfamily name due to my absent-mindedness.\n\nI was glad that it was him. Now it was the easiest for me to see him. The duke gave me the\nletter and told me that one clumsy sailor had brought it.\n\nThe captain was writing to me that he couldn’t dine with me today as agreed, because his\naffairs had changed. He was asking for my permission to postpone that Eastern idyll and to visit us\ntomorrow at ten o’clock in the evening.\n\nI came back inside with the duke. I retold the contents of the letter to I. Stroganoffs were\ninviting us to stay with them, but I. thanked and told them that he wanted to use this extra time to write\nsome letters, while I would have a chance to rest from the stress and running about.\n\nWe said good-bye to Stroganoffs, and I. offered Joan to spend the evening with us, but the\nold man reproached him categorically. He announced that Joan would dine with them and that at eight\no’clock in the evening he would take both Joan and Anna to our place.\n\n```\n“That’s great,” I. continued. “Perhaps, you will join us, too?” he addressed the duke.\n```\n```\nThe duke blushed, became embarrassed like a boy and agreed with joy.\n```\nWe left. I. was guiding me along the new road. He saw that I was catching crows, so he\nlaughed and took my arm.\n\n```\n“And so,” he told me, “the new life of Joan and the duke has begun.”\n```\n```\n“I see that the new life of the duke is clearer than Joan’s.”\n```\n“Maybe you are right, but if there’s any new life to begin here – that’s for Anna, not for those\ntwo,” I reproached him.\n\nI. stopped so suddenly that two elegant ladies who were following us ran into me. They\nbroke the panama off my head with their umbrellas not in an elegant way at all and they didn’t even think\nto apologize.\n\n```\nI got angry and gave a cry after them.\n```\n```\n“That’s the real Turkish behaviour!”\n```\nMaybe I looked comically being mad, because the Turk who was going past us gave a laugh,\nand I became totally furious.\n\n```\nI. took my arm tenderly once again.\n```\n```\n“Well, what a riddle you asked me... Well, that’s Lovushka,” I. was laughing.\n```\nWe came back to the hotel successfully. I was glad that I. didn’t have a habit to throw\nreprimands around, which I pattered to Joan today, because I deserved namely this mostly.\n\n\n# Chapter 18\n\n## The dinner at Stroganoffs’\n\nThe whole week of our uneasy life in Constantinople with the daily visits to the sick duchess,\nto Joan, to some passengers who were sailing with us flew past – and I not only had any time to read\nsomething, but I could hardly escape to see the city or some of its sights for an hour or two.\n\nMy head was still working with difficulty. I could see how the duke’s face was brightening,\nwhile his wife’s health kept improving. When she spoke up for the first time after such a long bellow –\nalthough not very clearly, but completely correctly, - and moved her right hand, he threw himself on I.’s\nneck and couldn’t find any words to express his gratitude.\n\nIt seemed to me that “the charming” reigned in Joan’s apartment – the children were\nfollowing only after Anna. Under the leadership of Stroganoff and his older daughter who was very cheerful\nand practical personality, Joan was running to shops and packing the cupboards and counters with ribbons,\nplumes, sparkling threads, all sorts of silks and rice straws from which Anna’s hands were putting not just\nexamples, but wonderful works of art.\n\nIn the beginning it seemed to me that this medium filled with the fuss and all sorts of\nelementary trifles of life were absolutely not meant for Anna. Only when I saw with what taste, beauty and\nnobility this entire room began to small when every entering person’s face used to change from Anna’s\ncalm and kindness, I understood what her words about the daily routine that was turning into a shining\ntemple meant.\n\nIt seemed that the children were dressed with Anna’s taste and care, too. A tender Turkish\nnurse was looking after them perfectly, and here they were feeling safe from their mother’s hot-tempered\nlove that was always suddenly jumping from a caress into a scream.\n\n```\nJoan already made several hats, and the shop’s opening was planned in three days.\n```\nThe duke used to visit Joan daily, but it seemed to me that the real tone of friendly relations\nhadn’t yet settled between them, while the duke was idolizing Anna simply purely an joyfully as a being\nstanding higher than himself.\n\nIn his new life which I could see so clearly, a kind man with a strong character who\nsometimes simply stunned me with his unexpected persistence was maturing, or perhaps to be precise,\nwas revealed.\n\nAnna was always evenly tender to me, but my overheard conversation which always used to\nemerge unwittingly exhausted my self-control so much that each time I used to become ashamed. A\nhundred of times I gave my word to finally confess everything to her, but everything used to end so that I\nonly would stand in front of her, blushed like a schoolboy who was caught playing pranks improperly.\n\nOne time, having noticed such a state of mine for several times, I. looked me up and down\nmore intently, gave a smile and told me tenderly.\n\n“Here’s the lesson for you how to live in compromise. If self-respect is pulsating in man in a\nliving thread, then he will feel the greatest suffering when he wants to sift that respect with powdered\nsugar and to hide the fallen drop of the tar. You are suffering, because the integrity of your nature cannot\n\n\ntolerate any falsehood. So is it really so difficult to find the way out of the situation if the truth that is hiding\nin your heart is demanding it?”\n\n“I haven’t told you anything, Lolion, and once again you found out everything, but if you are\nsuch a clairvoyant, then you should understand how difficult it is for me now. How could I confess to Anna\nthat I heard everything and that I know her secret? How to confess to her that I was sitting hypnotized like\na rabbit in front of a snake and I couldn’t make a move? Who else, except you who believe in my honour,\nwould believe in it?”\n\n“Lovushka, you don’t have to tell anything to anybody at all. You will never know what\nsecrets a man knows about another one’s life. I have already told you one time that there were no\ncoincidences in life. If you had to see another’s wound or an open heart hidden from others in one or\nanother way, be a well-bred person, and that means – don’t show by anything that you know something. If\nyour own conciliation of honour is tormenting you, then learn to carry on your suffering in such a way that\nthe others wouldn’t suffer from it and take out of this lesson an understanding how you shall act next time\nif you ever get into such a situation.”\n\nWe were talking, sitting in a small, shady public garden on our way home. The state that was\ntormenting me didn’t stop from these I.’s words, but I understood my false behaviour with Anna. Now it\nwas clear to me that in such cases one needed to summon up one’s strength and not to become a listener\nof secrets.\n\n“I think that no especial tragedy has happened this time, and if there was something wrong,\nthen it was only your absent-mindedness. If you had imagined that Florentian was standing next to you,\nthen you would have found enough strength to stand up and leave.”\n\n“What a horror!” I gave a shout. “If Florentian found out that I was listening secretly! That\nwould be the limit! I hope you won’t tell him?”\n\n```\nI. laughed infectiously.\n```\n“Lovushka, but did you tell me anything? Just imagine how many times Florentian’s thoughts\nand strength surpass mine, and you will understand the whole naivety of your question. Calm down. This\nlittle fact is only a small part of your spirit’s universities which happen to everyone who is seeking for\ndiscipline and who wants to educate himself...\n\nI received a telegram and a letter from Ananda. He left Moscow today. If his journey is\nsuccessful – which I don’t doubt, - then we’ll meet him in six days. I would like you to read one book which I\nhave prepared for you until that time. Having read that book, you will understand better what Ananda is\nseeking for, what Ali and Florentian have achieved already and hopefully, what you and me will achieve\nsome day,” I. was talking to me, while lifting me gently off the bench.\n\n“Oh, Lord! You are so kind and generous, Lolion. How you can compare yourself to the ill-\nmannered, unbalanced lad. If only I could ever be like you at least somewhat at something...” I answered\nmy friend, nearly in tears.\n\nHaving left the public garden, we got straight into the heat and the crowd of the fesses, red\nlike fly-agarics.\n\n“Today we are going to dine at Stroganoffs’. Anna wants to celebrate the beginning of her\nwork in her family circle,” I. was talking to me. “We must be the real cavaliers. We have to order the cake\nand flowers for the table, and to hand the bouquets of roses to both young owners of the shop – Anna and\nJoan, and to the mistress of that house – Stroganoff’s wife.”\n\n\n“I feel very uncomfortably,” I answered him. “I have never been in society, I have never seen\nthe dinner-party and I don’t know how to behave at all. It would be better if you came there alone, while I\ncould read the book at home.”\n\n“It’s impossible, Lovushka. You need to habituate yourself to the company of people and to\nbecome an example of tact and politeness everywhere. Remember Florentian, find strength within yourself\nand let’s go.”\n\n“I cannot imagine how I’m going to enter the room full of strangers. I’m certainly going to\nbrush against something, to forget myself or to start laughing if something seems to be funny to me,” I was\nmumbling through my nose, being not happy.\n\n“It is so strange, Lovushka. You possess a great literary talent, observation and sensitiveness,\nbut having met people, you cannot concentrate. When you enter the sitting-room where everybody will\nprobably be gathered already, don’t tramp the threshold absent-mindedly, searching for whom to greet,\nbut look over everyone calmly, with your eyes find the mistress and go straight to her. This time follow me\nand believe that there’s nothing for you to feel shy of in that house.”\n\nWe turned around the corner and ran into the captain face to face. The mutual joy of the\nmeeting showed what great friends we had become already. Having found out that we were searching for\nthe flowers and the cake, and that we wanted to find Anna’s favourite violet pansies very much, he only\nnodded his head.\n\n“There are lots of cakes, with or without an ice-cream, but to find great flowers off season –\nthat’s a serious task,” he uttered. “Since you are searching the flowers for the beauty whom one can see\nonly once during one’s lifetime, then it is worth trying to find them. Let’s drop in at my friend confectioner.\nHe’ll be fascinated with this order, because he owes me for a lot of things, then we will take a light carriage\nand rush along to visit one of my friend gardener. He’s living outside of the city, and if it is at all possible to\nfind great flowers in Constantinople – and even the pansies, - then we will get them.”\n\nWe walked across two streets quickly, as if at the word of command, and entered a rather\nunappealing confectioner’s shop. I was feeling disappointed. I wanted the orders to be fulfilled by some\nexcellent, extraordinary shop, and I already wasn’t expecting anything great here.\n\nAnd as always I was wrong. While the captain and I. were ordering some fanciful cake, the\nmistress of the shop who had wrapped herself up in a black cloak from head to foot brought me a pastry\nand a glass of a dark red, cold drink. I wasn’t charmed at all neither with one or another, but as soon as I bit\noff a piece of the pastry, I thrust the rest of it greedily into my mouth immediately. And when I took a sip of\nthe cold drink I was able to utter only this.\n\n```\n“Captain, this is Bagdad.”\n```\nThe captain and the owners laughed, my friends also ordered this miracle of Bagdad, and I\nquickly ate up the second portion, too.\n\nThe captain was hurrying us. We boarded our light carriage and rolled across the deserted\ncity which was lazily drowsing in the burning sun.\n\n“Well, you cannot decide by appearance,” I said to the captain. “I wasn’t happy that you\nbrought me to such dismal confectioner’s shop, but it turned out that in the evening someone might even\nswallow his tongue because of your cakes.”\n\n\nThe captain was laughing and telling me with humour how he was struggling with the\nsteamer’s repairs. He mentioned modestly that he settled all the poor from the steamer in several second-\nrate hotels from his own pocket.\n\n“Everything would be all right,” he sighed, “only the pretensions of the first and second class\nladies have tired me. And why they were created at all,” the captain was throwing up his hand comically.\n\n“I would like to take a look at you without any ladies. There would be no occasion for your\nyellow eyes to become the eyes of the tiger, and it would be hellish boring for yourself to give orders only\nto men.”\n\n“Lovushka, you hit straight to my heart for the second time, but my heart is strong and it’ll\nhold out, besides soon we’ll come to the place. You know, doctor I., if you allowed this young man to go to\nEngland with me, I guess he would take me in hand properly.”\n\nI. smiled to both me and the captain and began to talk how Joan’s destiny has taken a\nfavourable turn. The captain was listening to him attentively, and then he kept silent for a long time.\n\n“How can I know, I’m only a sea-dog, but in my imagination hats don’t suit Anna in any way.\nAnna is a goddess... and the hats!” the captain kept repeating.\n\n```\n“But a crowd of people will be wearing those hats,” I contradicted him.\n```\n“Oh, Lovushka, what kind of people they are. They are ladies, but not women. Well, we have\narrived already. Pay your attention to this view. Here all ladies will dash out of your heads.”\n\nAnd indeed, there was a lot to see, I even couldn’t make up my mind from which side the city\nlooked better.\n\nHowever, we couldn’t look round, because we stopped at a blank, high fence. The captain\nrang the bell at the gate, and a young Turk opened it immediately.\n\nHaving talked a little to that Turk who was showing his teeth merrily, the captain took us into\nthe depth of the garden. The beds of all sorts of flowers were extending along both sides of the walk. I had\nnever seen many of them. On the way the captain plucked off a little white blossom and extended it to me.\n\n“All gentlemen in England cling such blossom to the lapel of their jackets when they are\npreparing for a dinner. This is a gardenia. When you are going to dine, cling this blossom to your jacket,\nremembering me. You can even give it to the lady whom you will like the most,” he was speaking to me by\ntaking my arm.\n\n“I can really cling the blossom to my jacket in honour of yourself, but this dinner isn’t an\nEastern ball, and there will be no woman who is meant for me, although only the beauties would gather\nthere. Only Florentian is living in my heart, and I will leave your blossom at his portrait.”\n\nThe captain shrugged his shoulders, but he didn’t have time to answer me anything. A hefty,\nsluggish Turk was already going in front of us. He was so broad-shouldered that it seemed that he could lift\nthe terrestrial globe. He was the owner of the greenhouse. He greeted the captain like a good friend. I\nthought for a while one more time that I would really beware of him deciding by his appearance, and I\nwould even go round him from the distance in the late evening.\n\nWonderful orchids, as well as Parma violets were growing in the greenhouse. I. and the\ncaptain ordered some fanciful, fantastic baskets from orchids, some reddish gardenias and roses. We had\nto bring the violets with ourselves and hand them to Anna, while the roses were for her mother and Joan.\n\n\nBurdened ourselves with the light, wicker baskets where the flowers were placed on the\nmoist grass, all three of us came back to the hotel. We had time only to change our clothes. The captain\nwas sitting in the balcony, and only the fragments of his conversation to I. used to reach me. I. was telling\nhim that Ananda would arrive soon, whom he had promised to introduce to him; besides he promised to\ntake the captain to the Stroganoffs’ house, so that he could listen to the wonderful playing and singing of\nAnna.\n\n“I will be very thankful for this, doctor I. The evening spent with you in the company of the\nbeautiful musician maybe will give me strength to value the talent differently than I got used to by seeing\nthe performers going on the stage only for money. One time Lovushka gave a little scratch to my heart by\njoking how I would value my wife if she played for the wide public. I haven’t found an answer to this\nquestion up to now,” the captain was speaking, lost in thought.\n\n“Lovushka’s eyes are like awls not without reason. He has drilled a hole in my soul, but hasn’t\nput a bandage of peace on it,” I. laughed.\n\n“No, nobody can teach me peace. Only the storm – it doesn’t matter on land or sea – is kind\nand pleasant for me, but everywhere with me and around me is only the storm.”\n\nAnd then I showed myself: with the white, fine silk suit ordered by I., the black bow-tie, black\nwide belt-waistcoat and with the captain’s gardenia on the lapel. My already grown hair was beautifully\ncurled.\n\n“My God, but you are really handsome today, Lovushka! Be pitiful, Joan will be fascinated by\nyou completely,” the captain gave a shout.\n\nNeither his irony nor the attentive I.’s look disturbed me. Only my thoughts about Florentian\nand my brother were within myself. Today I had firmly decided to turn into Lovushka the catcher of the\ncrows not for a single time.\n\nWe went downstairs, said good-bye to the captain and got into the light carriage by holding\nthe baskets with the flowers carefully.\n\nSeveral coaches were already standing at the Stroganoffs’ house. I understood that besides\nus, there will be more guests. One more time I gave my word to be worth of Florentian and, having\nconcentrated all my attention, to think not about myself, but only about each of my company.\n\nThere were hall-stands across the walls in the spacious and bright Stroganoffs’ antechamber.\nOn them many summer cloaks were hanging and the whole pile of all sorts of hats were placed.\n\nTwo Turks took our hats, too, and helped us to take out the flowers. I was surprised, because\nonly now I saw what a miracle of beauty – two wonderful boutonnieres of violets – was covered in my\nbasket. I. was already holding three bunches of long-stemmed roses tied up with great Eastern ribbons in\nhis hands. He gave me the bouquet of reddish roses, took one of the violet boutonnieres from me and told\nme.\n\n“Lovushka, follow me. I will hand the bouquet to the senior mistress and Anna. You give the\nviolets to Anna and the roses to Joan. Don’t feel shy, feel free and remember how Florentian is conducting\nhimself everywhere.”\n\nThe comparison of such tall and grand figure of my idolized friend to my own medium height\nand small constitution, of his simple, but noble manners to my swiftness, a thought of how I would look like\n\n\nby imitating his grandeur seemed to be so comical to me that I could hardly hold my laughter, but I couldn’t\nsuppress my smile and I entered the sitting-room smiling.\n\nOnly men were here, and the sitting-room reminded me more of a smoking room – so much\nsmoke was here.\n\n“Well, finally you are here,” I heard the Stroganoff’s voice, who was coming to meet us. “I\nthink that my ladies have already started worrying about the culinary fancifulness and they are in a bad\ntemper. We were waiting for you in a family way, a little earlier, and you, dandies of the capital, arrive by\nobserving etiquette, a quarter of an hour before the beginning,” he was laughing by squeezing our hands.\n“Let’s come, I will introduce you to my old woman, and there’s no need to acquaint with the rest of the\nguests, because you will mix all ogly and pashas anyway,” he continued by taking I.’s arm.\n\nThe master brought us to a grand, elderly, but still not old woman with the black, silk dress\nwhich was very ordinary, but it looked well on her shapely and somewhat stout figure.\n\nI was stunned when I saw the lady’s face: her plait was surrounding her head in a heavy\ncrown and, to my great amazement, it was ash-coloured; her black eyes, the oblong oval of her face, her\ndark skin and wonderful hands – as though Anna herself was standing in front of me. Everything in her\nmother reminded me of her daughter, but... what a difference, what an abyss was between these two\nundisputed beauties.\n\n“I’m glad to see you at our place,” she said to I. by taking the flowers from him and thanking\nfor them. “My husband has told me so much about you.”\n\nShe had a deep voice just like Anna, but here was an abyss, too. It was a little hoarse, and\nnotes of a spoilt beauty were ringing in it, who was used to win victories with her beauty and to crush\neverybody. She gave me only a little smile and immediately directed her eyes towards a tall Turk with a fez\nand a European suit by continuing their already started conversation. I didn’t have time to reflect on the\nmaster’s wife, because Anna was already coming in front of us; only some icy stream ran across my heart,\nand I felt sorry for Stroganoff.\n\nAnna had a white, muslin dress on, her plait as usual was extending through her shoulders,\nher eyes were radiating by calling the memories to me about the Ananda’s eyes-stars. She extended her\nwonderful hand towards I., which he kissed, and twinkled her eyes merrily by taking the violets from him.\n\n“At last,” she uttered. “I could expect all kinds of surprises from you, but that you could hand\nme violets...”\n\nWhen in my turn I also gave her the bouquet of violets, then as though it took her breath\naway, such great her astonishment was.\n\n“You, too, you, too, managed to get my favourite flowers for me,” Anna was speaking by\ntaking my arm and bringing me out of the room’s centre where we were standing and drawing everyone’s\nattention. “You and your brother are spoiling me too much. Oh, if you knew what an emblem of happiness\nthese flowers are for me!”\n\n```\n“I know,” I uttered without thinking.\n```\n“Only when I saw an exceptional astonishment in her face I understood how foolishly I was\ncaught and, not allowing her to come to her senses, I asked her to show me where Joan was sitting among\nso many people. Finally a laughter changed the astonishment and anxiety in Anna’s face.\n\n\n“You are so strange, Lovushka,” she told me, “you almost stunned me,” and she laughed\neven merrier. “Here’s Joan and the duke for you. Have a good time and I’m going to continue the duties of\nthe hostess. You will be sitting next to me at the table, to be precise between me and Joan, because neither\nof us agreed to give you to somebody else,” and having smiled to all three of us, she left us.\n\n```\nI handed the roses to Joan and sat down next to her on a low Turkish arm-chair.\n```\nI couldn’t examine the big room properly, which was darkened with the drawn down curtain\nand lit up with the great number of lamps, I also couldn’t observe the guests who were walking in the\nroom, talking joyfully and loudly mostly in Turkish, because Joan was sputtering a hundred words per\nsecond, demanding my entire attention and even answers. I understood that mostly she was unsatisfied\nbecause I was going to sit on her right and not on her left where the duke had his seat planned.\n\n```\nFinally I succeeded to interrupt her and ask the duke about his wife’s health.\n```\n“Everything’s all right, Lev Nikolayevich. The duchess is already trying to hold a teaspoon in\nher hand and she’s happy like a child,” he answered.\n\nThe door of the sitting-room opened, and the host standing on the threshold invited\neveryone at the table.\n\nAnna was already hurrying towards me. One of the boutonnieres of the violets was fastened\non her chest and it stood out brightly on the white background of her dress by putting stress on the\npaleness of the skin of her face and her neck even more.\n\nHaving offered her my hand, I was walking in the row of couples, seeing in front of me Anna’s\nmother with that elegant Turk with whom she was talking when we came.\n\nWhen I sat down on the Anna’s indicated place, I got not only between her and Joan, but also\nin front of the young Ibrahim. He was dressed very elegantly in European style. We bowed one to another\npleasingly. A young Turkish lady was sitting next to him. Joan whispered to my ear that she was Stroganoff’s\nnice, the daughter of her sister; that Stroganoff herself who in any case was kind and joyful person was\nseeing the future Ibrahim’s wife in her. I felt sorry for my friend sincerely, because the girl’s face, although\nit was graceful, was rather dull. He could hardly expect such wife to enrich him with the moments of\ninspiration.\n\nThe guests were seated at the long table. The room was established in Eastern style, it was\ndecorated with many-coloured inlaid work, and two blue hues were prevalent. There wasn’t any furniture\nhere, except the low sofas which were covered with exceptionally luxury carpets and placed along the\nwalls.\n\nHaving looked at Anna, I saw that I. was sitting next to her, on another side of her, and the\nsenior Stroganoffs’ daughter was sitting next to him. I felt for I. from the bottom of my heart, because I\nknew perfectly, to put it mildly, the light-mindedness of this practical personality.\n\nAnna wasn’t eating much, but she was trying to acquaint me with the Eastern dishes very\nmuch. The guests didn’t have time to be sated with the snacks when two men brought in our ordered,\nfabulous flower baskets. Besides our flowers, there was also an original, very refined bouquet of orchids\nwhich was put in a wonderful, crystal vase and placed right in front of Anna.\n\n“Undoubtedly, this is the captain’s greeting, because we were choosing the flowers with\nhim,” I whispered silently to Anna’s ear.\n\n\n“If my heart today wasn’t pulsating with love so strongly, I would become angry, but today I\ncan’t be angry with anybody,” she answered me.\n\n“But why? The man bows before your beauty so much, he expresses his fascination so\nsincerely. Just look, how high his culture has to be in order to put the orchids in such a way. This is the\nwhole symphony of colours – from reddish to black, isn’t it? And you are talking that you could be angry\nwith him,” I gave a shout, being excited and offended for my friend.\n\n“Lovushka, you didn’t understand me. I have put it in a wrong way. Of course, the man who\nis able to present the flowers in such a way must be very artistic, but the captain is squandering that subtle\ntaste everywhere and for everybody like a toy of beauty. However, only that beauty is dear to my heart,\nwhich reflects the subtlety not only of one’s taste, but also of one’s spirit. Which blossom would you like to\nbring home – one of these wonderful, sumptuous pearl orchids or a little, fragrant violet?” she asked me.\n\n“One cannot formulate a question like this. The violet which you are holding in your hands\nand which you have called an emblem and your favourite flower isn’t a blossom or a thing for me anymore,\nbut a symbol. In the meanwhile, the captain’s flowers are simply the present of the fascinated man, his\ngratitude for meeting you,” I answered her. “I have noticed that the captain has made a rather poor\nimpression on you. I’m very sorry for that. Of course, he’s a tiger, but he possesses so much high nobleness,\nso much courage and... sometimes in his words I find so much resemblance to that what the most\nwonderful man whom luckily I was acquainted with is telling. I. promised to introduce him to Ananda and\nto give him a chance to listen to his singing.”\n\nThe sparkles began to rain from Anna’s face, her face turned pale. She turned to I., not\nanswering a word to me.\n\n“Lovushka, your neighbour on the right also wants to talk to you. Explain to us. The duke is\nlaughing at me and he doesn’t want to tell me the name of those flowers in front of Anna. They are\nartificial, aren’t they?” I heard Joan’s voice.\n\n```\n“No, Joan, these are orchids. Do you like them?”\n```\n“Not too much, Lovushka, your roses are much more wonderful and they smell sweet. Look\nat madam Stroganoff. Today she’s dissatisfied with everything. She doesn’t like very much that today\neverything is done for Anna here.”\n\n```\n“Why is it so?” I was astonished.\n```\n“Because Anna is the reason of the inner split in their family. She doesn’t want to accept her\nmother’s proposed perfect perspective to marry, but she’s living in her dreams and she’s friends with all\nsorts of poor persons. Besides, I suspect that her mother envies Anna’s beauty,” she added silently.\n\nI didn’t like this jabber of Joan. According to my understanding, it wasn’t very noble to\nslander those people who have helped her to start the new life so sensitively.\n\n```\n“Are you going to sing today?” I asked Anna who turned to me again.\n```\n“I wouldn’t like to, but most likely I will have to. There are several persons among our guests\nwho understand and value the music profoundly. My mother isn’t artistic, but the guest who’s sitting next\nto her is musical, he’s even considered to be a good singer,” she answered me, smiling mischievously.\n\n“Oh, what a pity, really what a pity that the captain won’t hear your singing. For him that\nwould have been more than necessary – maybe even an enlightenment of his spirit,” I gave a shout.\n\n\n“You are a perfect dreamer, Lovushka. It seems that I. wants to please you, so when Ananda\ncomes, I would have to organize a musical evening for a little circle of people. If you succeed to hear\nAnanda’s singing – then all other sounds will seem for you to be poor and unnecessary. Every time when I\nhear that voice I make sure of my insignificance.”\n\n“One can justify these words only with the grandeur of your talent and spirit. Only the\nperson who understands the radiance of the peaks can be unhappy with such talent as yours, which I. calls\ngreat.”\n\n```\n“Lovushka, today you must have decided to talk to me in riddles...” Anna laughed.\n```\n```\n“No, no, only if you knew how guilty I am before you...”\n```\nNot even having finished my sentence, I saw I.’s head coming out behind Anna, and his look\nreminded me of our conversation in the public garden. He asked Anna of something, while I turned to Joan\nby saving myself.\n\nThe dinner was going on as it was meant to be. I caught the look of the tall Turk of whose\nmusicality Anna was telling me several times. His fire, some demonic eyes would often turn to Anna.\nSometimes a brutal expression of hatred used to flash in them, especially when he was looking at I., talking\nto her.\n\n```\n“Well, well,” I thought. “Is my dear I. going to be responsible for Ananda’s sins?”\n```\nI didn’t even have time to think a little longer about it when the tall Turk stood up, took the\nglass of champagne into his hand and bowed before his neighbour, the mistress of the house with dignity\nand even solemnly. She smiled to him and tapped the knife into her crystal glass.\n\nAll voices hushed immediately, everyone’s eyes turned towards the Turk who wanted to\npropose a toast.\n\nAfter a long and exhaustive glorification of the parents – it must have been accustomed to do\nso in the East, but it seemed to be hypocritical for me – he proceeded to the hero of the festivities, their\nyoungest daughter. He was talking in French, stating that there were some people at the table, who knew\nonly that language. He uttered that in the most innocent tone, as though he had satisfied the most\nelementary demand of politeness, but there was such acidity and insulting jeering in his eyes, face and his\nentire figure that all my blood flowed to my head. I didn’t doubt that he was mocking Joan from inside,\nalthough everything seemed to be normal outwardly.\n\nAnna who was looking down, now looked at me with her extremely deep look as though\nconfirming the vanity and senselessness of the current surroundings. I had to put some effort in order to\nlisten attentively to the orator’s speech. His voice was picturesque, imperious, his speech was correct, he\nwas pronouncing every letter extremely clearly.\n\nSince I was observing the man so attentively, I lost the thread of his speech, and I managed\nto focus my thoughts only in the end of his long toast where apparently the main point was hiding.\n\n“You aren’t just a pearl of the Bosporus for us, which could decorate any harem or palace,\nbut you are the woman whose beauty and talents don’t have enough space on the earth. And what do we\nsee? This woman wants to work independently, prick her wonderful little fingers with needles and pins.\nShame on us, the men of Constantinople who were unable to win the heart of the most beautiful beauty of\nthe whole world.\n\n\nIf we didn’t succeed to do that up to now, then let’s announce ourselves to be jealous guards\nand don’t allow anybody other than a Turk to take this treasure from us. I propose a toast to eternal\nwomanhood, beauty, passion, woman who embellishes and supplements a man’s life, but not to a worker.\nTo royal beauty – a royal place in life!”\n\nHaving finished his speech, he clinked glasses with Stroganoffs and turned around the table\ntowards Anna.\n\nI didn’t hear what Anna told I., but I could see her pleading look, his return smile and a nod\nof his head.\n\nThe Turk was coming nearer to us. All guests were standing up to clink glasses with Anna and\nthe hosts by prolonging the Turk’s toast with play of their words. His face took an expression of a satanic\nimpudence, anger and jealousy, as if he had decided to do something, to risk of something even if that was\nmenacing to become a scandal.\n\n```\nI began to quiver. This satanic physiognomy was terrifying me.\n```\nAll of a sudden, when there were three or four steps left before us, the Turk turned all pale,\nhe turned pale so much that even his lips became pale. He began to stagger, touched his heart with his\nhand. Everybody hurried to help him, but he had recovered already. He was trying to smile, but it was\nobvious that he didn’t understand what had happened.\n\nWhen he touched his heart, a bracelet fell out of his hands, and as I understood, it was made\nof reddish corals. Later I. explained to me that it was made of reddish corals and the same reddish brilliants.\nIt was an invaluable thing.\n\nIt seemed that he wanted to put this treasure on Anna’s hand secretly from everybody, but\nthe sudden pain betrayed this want of his. Somebody lifted the bracelet from the floor and gave it back to\nhim, which he put into his pocket in vexation. He went up to Anna. Now he could hardly walk, he was\nstooped and looked old at once, almost ugly.\n\nHe hardly had any strength to clink glasses with Anna who stood up to meet him. He didn’t\nutter a word to her, although his eyes were going upward onto his forehead from his efforts, then suddenly\nhe turned round and went back to his place.\n\nI was observing him without stopping. It was strange to me that he could hardly walk\ntowards our side, but now he found strength for such a sudden turn away from us, and his later behaviour\nseemed even stranger: the closer he was coming to his place, the lighter his walk became, and when he sat\ndown in his place next to the host of the house, he was already mocking himself joyfully, saying that\napparently, an attack of angina pectoris had started for him.\n\nI still didn’t have time to perceive everything what had happened when the clinking of a knife\nto the glass interrupted the talking and laughter of the guests: it seemed that this time the host of the\nhouse rose for the return toast.\n\n“First of all, I want to thank the guest for such high glorification of the “pearl’s” parents,\nalthough I absolutely don’t feel being worth of such high praise and I see only the guest’s Eastern politeness\nin those words, while his mentioned differences between the pure-blooded Turks and Europeans, between\nthe working ones and those who are living at the expense of somebody else, then...” here he blinked an eye\nin a funny way and continued, “Well, our honourable orator calls himself to be a Turk. His name is\nAlphonse. Is there such Turkish first name? His family name is da-Bracano. Could there be such Turkish\nfamily name?”\n\n\n```\nThe laughter was heard all around.\n```\n“His family name tells us about Spaniards, Moors, even Italians – anything you want, but not\nabout the Turks. The psychology and politeness of our honourable friend might be pure Turkish – this is the\nmatter of his taste and liking.\n\nIf we are talking about my Russified family, then everyone in it is working, and when I close\nmy eyes, all the members of this big family will be standing firmly on their feet and go through life in\nmaterial independence.\n\nThis day is the happiest one in my life, because my youngest daughter, the only adult\nmember of our family, who hasn’t yet worked independently up to now, became independent and started\na big business. I also congratulate all women who are educated and working; not those women toys and\nwomen dedicated to entertainments, but the women who are friends of their husbands and children. Long\nlive the happiness to work, the only one real man’s happiness!”\n\nAnd Stroganoff, just like the Turk, was going round the entire long table towards Anna by\nkissing his wife’s hand on his way.\n\nThis time I noticed that Stroganoff was very excited when he bent his head over his wife,\nwhen he clinked glasses with da-Bracano and with his younger son who was taking advantage of an\nexceptional guardianship of his mother.\n\nBy appearance he was a handsome youth with ash-coloured hair, black eyes, dark-\ncomplexioned like his mother, but some repulsive bestiality was felt in this beauty of his. It was clear that\nthe Turk was an example of good style for him, who showed an exceptional attention and tenderness to\nhim. It was obvious that his mother had spoilt him, so he was extremely haughty.\n\nI turned into Lovushka the catcher of the crows, I forgot everything in the world and\nsuddenly I saw some degenerated grey being behind the youth’s back. That was as though him, as though\nnot him, but only his portrait in twenty years. His forehead and face were wrinkled, there were some lumps\non his hands, his deep and sunken eyes were gaping like hot coals. His mouth was distorted with anger.\n\nI could neither separate that second figure from the youth neither merge them into one. I\nalready raised my hand and wanted to shout to him: “Beware of the villain behind your back, drive him\naway,” but somebody took my hand, and I heard Stroganoff’s voice.\n\n“Whom now are you sharpening your writer’s awls at? Ah, you are interested in my youngest\nson. Well, he isn’t working yet. His mummy wakes him up in the morning and herself brings him the\nchocolate to his bed. The youngest one is usually considered to be a baby, although with his experience he\nalready outrivals the old men, too.\n\nLet’s hug one another, Lovushka. I see that my royal rose of the Bosporus accepts you to her\nheart, and this is a rare occurrence.”\n\nI could hardly hold out this hug of his, and this happened only because I. went up to Joan,\nsqueezed my hand and whispered to me: “Think only about Florentian.”\n\nWhen everybody took their seats and our ordered cakes and ice-creams were brought on the\ntable, the cries of gratification were heard. It seemed that the owner of the confectionery knew well the\ntaste of the public in Constantinople.\n\nAnna stopped talking silently to I., turned to me and looked at me attentively with her black\neyes.\n\n\n“Oh, Anna, how unhappy I am. I wish this endless dinner to end as soon as possible. And why\npeople eat so much? It seems to me that since we came to Constantinople I always only eat and sleep. To\ntell you the truth, I also see clearly how I am losing my mind,” I was complaining to Anna pitifully.\n\n```\nHer tender hand stroked my hand put on my knee, and she told me friendly.\n```\n“Lovushka, hold tight somehow. I feel for you from the bottom of my heart. I would like to\nhelp you very much somehow. Look at me only like at the closest and loving sister.”\n\nHer voice was so tender, such kindness was spurting from her eyes that I couldn’t hold out\nanymore. The tears were already gathering in my throat. All of a sudden I saw I.’s hand extending towards\nme, and in it there was an Ali’s pill placed on the napkin. I quickly grabbed the medicine like a lifebuoy and\nswallowed it. To my great joy, I heard the noise of the chairs being pulled away from the table.\n\nThe guests dispersed in balconies and sitting-rooms where the black coffee made in Turkish\nstyle was waiting for them.\n\nI was begging I. not to leave me alone and to go home as soon as possible. We went to the\nbalcony with the duke where the stars were already twinkling like diamonds in the dark sky. It looked like\nthere was a rain, because the drops were still quivering on the leaves of the trees here and there, and the\nflowers smelt extremely strongly.\n\n“Here it is, the sweet-scented night of the South, but you are wrong if you think that you see\nthe rain-drops. Only by Stroganoff’s order, the trees, flowers and lanes were watered, so it wouldn’t be so\nstifling. You want to leave, but don’t you want to listen to Anna’s playing and singing? Don’t be an egoist,” I.\ntold me in a more silent voice. “You understand that it would be even more difficult for Anna here today\nwithout us, don’t you? Didn’t you understand that great power of pure love and will has helped me to\nprotect her from that satanic Turk?”\n\n“Doctor I., I have a great favour to ask you,” all of a sudden the duke spoke up, who was\nimmersed in his thoughts up to now.\n\n```\n“I’m glad to be of service for you,” I. answered him very vividly.\n```\n“You see, I’ve been always looking for an opportunity to repay you for all your kindness for\nme and my wife, but all the ways that I was analysing in my thoughts seemed to be vulgar to me. But it\nseems that I’ve found something anyway, although in this case you could blame me of egoism even more\nthan ever before. Your friend has to come to you. I wonder if a hotel’s confusion is pleasing for him. In the\nmeanwhile there are two rooms with an absolutely separate entrance in my big and empty house.\n\nThere are three empty rooms more next to these ones. I have already made arrangements\nwith Stroganoff and started repairing them. Everything will be finished in a couple of days, the furniture will\nbe delivered. I have already bought an excellent piano, too, so that your friend and Anna could play at my\nhouse if they only wanted to.\n\nThere’s a room on the second floor for the youth who is coming with your friend. It has\nseparate stairs to the rooms of Ananda, Lovushka and yourself. As you can see, I have already thought\nabout everything. In the presence of the quick separation, don’t refuse that happiness for me and be my\nguest,” the duke was speaking silently, almost pleading.\n\n```\nI. went up to him, extended his hand and told him.\n```\n“Whatever form I would give to my gratitude, I will make you glad mostly with the words\nthat it is rare when man’s help is such timely and needed as this proposal of yours. I and Lovushka have\n\n\nalready gotten tired of the hotel’s racket, while our friends need to rest for a long time already. I thank you\non our behalf. We will be glad of the possibility to live in the quiet house for a while, because it seems that\nwe will still be delayed here for almost a month.”\n\n```\n“What a happiness this is!” the duke exclaimed.\n```\nJoan came to the balcony to invite us for a coffee drink. She surprised me with something,\nand only in the light of the room I understood that she had changed her dress. To my question why did she\ndo it, she answered me that there was such a fashion in Constantinople, and the ladies were changing their\ntoilets during the festive dinner.\n\nI also saw madam Stroganoff here. She had a light, lilac dress on, which suited her hair, but\nmade too strong contrast to her skin. Maybe it was beautiful, but I didn’t like it.\n\nWith my eyes I was searching for Anna by deciding which colour I would like to see and I\nwanted to imagine her charming figure only in a white background.\n\nI was glad when I saw that she was wearing the same dress. Having taken a good look at Joan\nwho was buried in green ruffles, suddenly I gave her a piece of my mind.\n\n“I’m not a Parisian, I’m only a lad who hasn’t seen the world, but in your place I wouldn’t\nhave put such a vulgar dress on in any way. Your previous dress was modest and nice, it only made you\nmore distinct, while this greenness overshadowed you and besides it just shouts about your bad taste to\neverybody. For God’s sake, just don’t make your hats of such style, because then you will push away the\nnoble ladies and attract the market public to your atelier.”\n\n“That’s because,” Joan was talking to me nearly in tears, “I chose the first dress myself, and\nmadam Stroganoff gave me this one.”\n\nThe duke and I. went up to us, and we sat down in the corner to drink our coffee. Anna was\nsitting on the sofa at the central table, and the ill-fated da-Bracano was sitting on the chair next to her.\n\nHe was telling her something with his eyes fastened upon her. Anna’s face was unfeeling, as\nif with a mask that didn’t allow to see the depth of her soul. She lifted her eyes only once, ran her eyes over\nthe room and looked at her father pleadingly. He stood up immediately and sat down on the sofa next to\nher.\n\n“Well, my daughter, I want to drink a cup of coffee poured with your kind hands,” her father\nwas smiling to her.\n\nAnna stood up in order to take the coffee-pot. I saw fury and hatred in the eyes of the Turk\nonce again; but he was controlling himself perfectly and sipping his coffee with a smile.\n\n“Lolion, please don’t step back from me, but I’m strong already, as though Ali himself was\nhere and not only his pill in me. It seems to me that if that Satan stays longer next to Anna, then she won’t\nbe able to sing. Could you curve him so much that he had to get out of here?” I was whispering to him.\n\nI. laughed and answered me that he relied on my strength and self-control, and that he\nwould certainly go to Anna’s table; but he was asking me to sit down next to him without fail as soon as the\nmusic would start, and he would take the place for me. It would be even better that as soon as the talking\nabout singing starts, I would come to him instantly. Having talked a little to the duke and Joan, he went to\nAnna’s table where the whole company of men had gathered as though to the magnet.\n\n```\nThe drinking of coffee continued.\n```\n\n“You know, duke, I couldn’t live in the East. Once I participated in a wedding feast. The\nguests there were strictly divided into a manly and womanly sides, and I, of course, could see only the\nmen’s feast. They were eating with their hands, they were eating till the falling down, till the ninth sweat,\nwhile the dismal Eastern music was playing. That was terrible, but picturesque, although barbarous.\nEverything here is already as though covered with culture and civilization – and there’s a gluttony till the\nsweat anyway. The only difference is that they are working by the sweat with their perfumed handkerchiefs\nand not their greasy hands.\n\nWell, tell me, isn’t it a barbarism to be so exhausted, to sprawl so much because of eating\nlike these ones who are sitting in front of us,” I gave a nod to the guests who were sitting on the sofa and\nchairs, and who had gotten absolutely befogged because of the grave digestion.\n\nThe requests to sing and to play were heard. Many were asking Bracano to sing; he was\nputting on airs and – imagining himself to be a hero – he was answering that he wasn’t completely well, but\nthat he would try anyway. “You’d better not try to,” I thought for myself venomously and I decided to ask I.\nto give him some drops at any price, so that he would get hoarse and, as it is said, he would “let out a\nsqueak” while singing.\n\nBeing excited by this desire, I forgot about any politeness, I left my friends and ran to I.\nHaving seized his hand, I started asking him to make it so that this Turkish intriguer would make a fool of\nhimself and would let out a squeak while singing.\n\n```\n“What a kid you still are, Lovushka,” I. was laughing at me.\n```\n“Lolion, my dearest, my best, my kindest, don’t allow this villain to torture Anna. His voice is\nprobably good only for singing Satan’s couplets,” I was whispering to him.\n\n“Stop, Lovushka,” I. answered me very seriously. “Observe everything attentively, capture,\nremember everything well what you see and hear today. You’ll understand a lot much later. Today here an\nhour will strike for Anna and for some others, which will determine their entire life. Be serious, don’t play\npranks like a kid.”\n\n```\nHe looked at me almost sternly.\n```\nThe host invited all guests to go to the big hall, not to that one across which we entered the\nhouse from the street, but to another one inside of the house. There we went down the wide and beautiful\nstairs and got into a big, round sitting-room that belonged to Anna personally. Ah, what a wonderful room\nthat was: its floor and walls – a continuous mosaic of wood, in the middle – a grand piano, along the walls –\nsmall chairs, several vases placed on pedestals, several paintings and marble sculptures.\n\nAs soon as Anna went up to the grand piano, I forgot about everything. A smile was shining\nin her face, her cheeks were burning, her eyes were radiating. That wasn’t that Anna whom I had already\nbeen used to see, that was a fairy, an unearthly being. If up to now Anna already looked like an especial for\nme, not that one whom the earth is carrying, then now I understood that unearthly beings were still\nwalking among us by bringing the sky down onto the earth.\n\n```\nShe started playing. I recognized the Beethoven’s sonata immediately.\n```\nI cannot understand up to now how not only me, but all of us could withstand that music. A\nfurious tempo was breaking out from Anna. It seemed that a supernatural force had inspired her. Passions\nwere replaced with a call for something unreachable, unknown; a sudden insight – and then questions once\nagain, an inevitable voice of destiny was heard once again...\n\n\nI was crying with my face covered with my hands. I heard how the duke was crying next to\nme. “Here it is, the grey daily routine turned into a shining temple,” I was thinking.\n\nThe sounds died away, no one was disturbing the silence. I. squeezed my hand slightly as\nthough by reminding me of self-control. And he did it just in time.\n\n“You, Anna, as always just make everybody nervous and spoil the celebration with your\nplay,” and unpleasant, nasal and capricious voice of her younger brother was heard. “You’d rather play\nChopin, show your perfect play, but you’ve just eclipsed everybody with that Beethoven.”\n\n```\nI wanted to beat that future wrangler and pugnacious fellow.\n```\n“You can leave if you don’t like it. And I will thank you very much for doing so,” his father\nuttered silently, but such a menace was seen in his face that the ill-mannered urchin hid himself behind his\nmummy’s back like a cowardly dog.\n\n```\nHis mother smiled and shook her finger coquettishly at him like at a five-year-old toddler.\n```\n```\nThis unpleasant incident was unable to dispel the great impression created by Anna.\n```\nShe couldn’t resist the requests and started playing again, but we didn’t hear any serious\nmusical compositions anymore, and it seemed that some little part of her being had flown out with her first\ncomposition. There wasn’t any supernatural inspiration in her play anymore, too.\n\n```\nI wanted to crush that good-for-nothing urchin for such a rude escapade.\n```\nAnna stood up and announced that she wouldn’t play and sing anymore, but if there was\nanybody who wanted to sing, she would accompany him.\n\n```\nBracano rose and told her that he couldn’t refuse such miraculous accompaniment.\n```\nI looked at I. His face was strict, oh how strict it was, like before the storm in the steamer. He\nlooked at Anna, as though he would have sent her strength.\n\nThe Turk straightened his collar, pulled his waistcoat and announced that he would sing a\nsong which would open the secret of his heart.\n\n```\nEveryone became quiet. He announced that he would sing a serenade by Shubert.\n```\nI gave a deep sigh. I looked round horror-struck, looked at the duke and at the singer who\nnow looked more like a toreador breathing with hell’s fire than a tender lover inviting us to listen to the\nmeaning of the nightingale’s song, to the prayer, to the heart’s vibration. I could hardly refrain from\nsniggering.\n\nAnna didn’t need any notes. She looked at I., raised her eye-brows a little, her fingers\ntouched the keys gently.\n\n“My songs are drifting softly in the silence of the night...” all of a sudden a strong boss began\nto roar like the ship’s hooter.\n\nNow I already sniggered, huddled up and hid myself behind I. When this roar reached the\nhighest note, an absolutely unexpected thing happened: suddenly the roaring boss turned into the highest\nand such hideous falsetto that loud laughter was immediately heard in all corners. I and the duke were\nlaughing, too. Even Anna was looking at the singer amazed, although not a laughter, but an unpleasant\nannoyance was revealed in her face. Apparently, first of all an insulted soul of the artist reacted within her.\n\n\n“No, I cannot sing, I’m ill today,” the singer told us, trying to smile. And he left the room, not\ntaking a look at anybody.\n\nThe hostess of the house and her beloved son dashed after him, while the rest of the guests\nwho were confused and choking with laughter started breaking up, too.\n\nWe, Anna, her father, the duke and Joan were the last ones who left. We said sincere good-\nbye to the hosts and promised them to call at the shop tomorrow at around six o’clock and inquire about\ntheir first working day.\n\n\n# Chapter 19\n\n## We stay at the duke’s house\n\nTo be continued...\n\n\n# Chapter 20\n\n## To be continued...\n\nTo be continued...\n\n",
